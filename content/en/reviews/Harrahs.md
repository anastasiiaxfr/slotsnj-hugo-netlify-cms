### OVERVIEW OF GAMES AT HARRAH’S ONLINE CASINO
When it comes to games availability, Harrah’s Online Casino is quite behind. It makes use of an 888 developed software technology. Little wonder it shares similar game offers with 888 Online Casino. It has a low level of game variety for players. The games offered by Harrah’sCasino.com are from two developers – Williams and 888. Harrah’s has only one version of blackjack as a table game and just four roulette titles. However, the Casino has an easy-to-navigate lobby.

### HARRAH’S ONLINE TABLE GAMES
Harrah’s only offer two games (Roulette and Blackjack) as part of its table games. The good news is that these games are designed and presented appropriately. They are very easy to play and this makes it easy for players to gamble at a very long length. The actions buttons on the table games are well arranged and this makes it more comfortable for players to depict their skills.

Harrah’s present the best form of Roulette in NJ. Its graphics is enticing. It is characterized with the duo of single-zero and double-zero wheels. The single-zero games are “High Limit French Roulette” and “High Limit European Roulette” while the double-zero games are “High Limit American Roulette” and “Roulette.”
 
The double-zero games are characterized with a house edge of 5.26%. However, the French version, which is from the French table is an awesome version for you to play. It is roulette’s lowest house edge version you can have access to in NJ.

### HARRAH’S BLACKJACK
 
it is designed appropriately with comfortability for players. It has typical rules – 6 decks, there are dealers on all 17s; however, a player can split once. You are allowed to bet from one to five in each round.

### HARRAH’S ONLINE OTHER GAMES
There are other games on Harrah’s online casino. There are Video poker. Although VP is the weakest game you can get on Harrah’s. it doesn’t have a good paytable. Also, there are Slots for many selections to make. The available choices for slots are more than what one can get from table games. I have identified other new games on Harrah’s Casino. Below is a list of the games:
*	Silent Movie
*	Shamrockers
*	Pixies of the Forest
*	Da Vinci Diamonds
*	Big Foot
*	Judge Dredd

## MOBILE APPS FOR HARRAH’S ONLINE CASINO
Harrah’s Casino has Apps for mobile devices. The Harrah’s Casino App is available for Android. Also, there is a consideration for iOS. An amazing thing about the mobile app of Harrah’s casino is that it gives access to more slot games than what the web version has to offer. However, the Harrah’s promotion code doesn’t work on the app. Harrah’s removed the function on purpose. Also, the apps are not of good quality. They tend to be affected by bugs and glitches consistently. There is another good thing about the app, however: it can be used to make both deposit and withdrawal.

## BANKING METHOD
In order to prevent the disruption of player’s gaming, Harrah’s has quick and easy deposit options for its players. The payments and withdrawal options available for players are verified. They are also linked to every player to make sure that the transactions ongoing are secure.

## CONCLUSION
Harrah’s online Casino really has its pros and cons. While a player is limited to a number of games, there are also lots of promotions and bonuses for every player. The game is great for roulette fans and for blackjack players alike. For slot players, they have choices to make, however, there is a restriction on their choices. If for no other reason, the benefits you tend to get in terms of bonuses and promos are quite impressive for any player to sign up. I believe the competition on going presently in NJ gaming industry will end up forcing the operators to upgrade and update their services.
