While Draft Kings isn’t exactly a casino, it is a major sports betting site that has to be included. Everyone that is a fan of local teams uses this site, so it is the number one rated sports app. With over $7 billion paid out since the site went live a few years ago, it’s clear that this is an incredibly popular betting site that is very legitimate.

DraftKings Casino is a betting site that is brought and owned by DraftKings sports betting company in NJ. DraftKings is based in Boston, with the majority of its sports betting held there. However, with the addition of NJ among the sports betting in June 2018, DraftKings quickly decided to capitalize on the online casino site as well as their sportsbook. Since then, they continue being at the top of sports betting in the state.

While initially online casino games were just a part of their sportsbook app, soon DraftKings decided to expand it into the separate online casino app. That’s how DraftKings Online came into existence, by being gradually transferred and developed into a new platform. However, for now, there is no dedicated mobile DraftKings application just yet, though there are rumors that it will be released in 2019.

With that extension, DraftKings has coined a new partnership with resorts. This will allow Resorts to get a foothold in online sports gambling, and for DraftKings to improve the quality and the size of their online casino repertoire. 

## DRAFTKINGS NJ CASINO SOFTWARE
So far, DraftKings NJ is only represented through the mobile app, and it seems that they intend to continue with that trend. While being the only fully mobile online casino in NJ is an interesting idea, it could be a very niche thing, so unless they have a major attraction, they can lose out on the audience and revenue.

Casino’s mobile application is one of high quality, however. For now, it still shares the same app with the DraftKings sportsbook, but there is a separate mobile app just for the online casino part, so it is something to look out for in the future.

You can explore options that DraftKings offer to you before signing up to play for real money, and the navigation of the site and settings feels smooth and intuitive. Streamlined menus, clear labels, and a good structure allow for a pleasant experience. Graphics and animations are also top-notch, with great design and aesthetics. 

The game range is currently rather limited, as there is a transfer underway, so the expanding of the gaming catalog is not the highest priority for the casino. Still, the partnership of DraftLings Online with Resorts Casino promises to significantly diversify the existing game roster.

The app itself is compatible with both iOS and Android devices, as well as a mobile browser. The latter was completed in February 2019, so it is a relatively recent addition.

To access the casino, install the DraftKings Online Sportsbook app, and click on the “More Games” button. If you are located in NJ, you will have access to the casino’s catalog. As this casino is integrated with a sportsbook, players have a shared wallet for both of them.

## DRAFTKINGS CASINO GAME CATALOG
Since DraftKings, at least for now, is just a part of their sportsbook, the number of games in its catalog is fairly modest. Another reason for that would be the fact that the casino is young. DraftKings Online only recently decided to enter the online gambling scene, before that focusing on the online sports betting aspect. With that addition, DraftKings has a chance to enter the top list of online gambling scene, if they focus on their casino as they did on their sportsbook app.

However, since the New Jersey online gambling constantly evolves, they will need to move fast to catch up.

For now, DraftKings NJ offers only six slot games, all from IGT, including CATS, Wheel of Fortune and Cleopatra, which are some of the biggest hits from IGT. There are other classics in the catalog as well, for example, Triple Diamond and Fantastic Fireworks. It would be great for the DraftKings NJ Casino to expand the number of slot games that they have, including games from other companies, like Bally and H5 Gaming.

Still, going by how fast DraftKings is developing, it is certain that they wouldn’t dally. We expect them to quickly expand their catalog to the acceptable levels among NJ casinos. Their choice of games should include various options, including the following:  

* Video slots
* Jackpot slots
* Blackjack
* Roulette
* Slingo
* Table games
* Video poker
* Virtual Sports

Even better, DraftKings Casino has a variety of betting limits, catering to all different clients and pockets. There are low-betting options for casual players, and most of the games, excluding live dealers, can be played with demo money. That means that you can just play for fun, without a need to worry about losing money and deposits. Obviously, you wouldn’t be able to withdraw any winnings. So to be able to get some cash, you will need to deposit and play with real money.

The minimum stakes are starting at $0.10 per game, so every player can start gaming right away, and you will be able to boost your bankroll for minimum risk.

## LIVE DEALER GAMES
While the rest of the catalog is pretty slim at the moment, there is a great category of games that DraftKings Casino offers at better quality than most of its competitors. And that is a niche of live dealer games, which becomes more and more popular with each passing day. The casino’s tables are powered by Evolution Gaming, which operates its own studio for this type of games.

You can access the live dealer section of games on the site (or in the app) through the tab “More Games”. Tables are available at 10 AM through the 4 AM each day. As with all live dealer games from Evolution, those ones feature HD webcams, in-game chat with other players and dealers, various betting limits, and different camera angles for your convenience.

The stakes start at $1, and end at $1,000+, so every player, from a newbie to a gambling veteran with deep pockets, can find their comfortable betting range. Players can bet on the following games:

Live Baccarat: the minimum bet is $1, and the maximum payout is $5,000, with a return to player rate of 98.76%.
Live Blackjack: six live blackjack tables, five with traditional rulesets, and one Live Unlimited Blackjack. There could be any number of players on one table, so there is no need to wait for a seat opening. The betting range is from $1 to $1,000.
Live Casino Hold’em: this game features bonus bets and a whopping 97.64% of RTP, so you can win for up to $250,000, with the minimum bet of $1.

Live Roulette: there are three variants of roulette games available: single view and multi-view roulette have standard rulesets, while live casino floor roulette allows to immerse yourself into the casino atmosphere. It is streames straight from the Atlantic City, and runs 24/7, unlike other live games. The minimum bet is $1.

## DRAFTKINGS BONUS CODE AND PROMOTIONS
If you are a first-time customer of DraftKings Casino, then you are in luck. There exists a $35 bonus for new players, that grants people a way to test which games are the best for you, and what sports you enjoy the most.

To activate that bonus, you won’t need to enter any DraftKings promo codes. You just need to download the app and click on the “Claim Free Credits” link. After that, you will be prompted to create an account. With that done, just log in, and the bonus will be applied to your account. You can use the bonus cash on any game in the DraftKings Online Casino.
