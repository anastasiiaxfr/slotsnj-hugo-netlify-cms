The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has prohibited batsman Umar Akmal from all types of the game for a long time, after he neglected to report degenerate match-fixing draws near. 

The Pakistan worldwide was temporarily suspended in February, officially accused of two breaks of the PCBs against defilement code, under Article 2.4.4 

The Article expects players to report any methodologies made to take part in degenerate practices to the PCB Vigilance and Security Department, immediately; however he was administered to have neglected to report such commitment on two separate events. 

Earlier this month, Akmal ruled against challenging the charges, in this way viably tolerating the charges forced by the disciplinary board of trustees administrator, Justice Fazal-e-Miran Chauhan. 

PCB chief of hostile to debasement and security, Asif Mahmood, stated: &#171;The PCB doesnt enjoy any observing a promising universal cricketer being proclaimed ineligible for a long time on defilement accusations, however this is by and by a convenient suggestion to all who figure they can escape by penetrating the counter defilement code. 

&#171;The enemy of debasement unit routinely holds instruction classes and supplemental classes at all levels to help every expert cricketer to remember their commitments and duties. What&#8217;s more, and, after its all said and done, if a few cricketers choose to assume control over the code, this is the manner by which things will work out. 

The batsman has played multiple times for Pakistan across three organizations of the game, last highlighting in October 2019, his 84th T20 International appearance; he had as of late been in and out of the side because of a few disciplinary issues.
