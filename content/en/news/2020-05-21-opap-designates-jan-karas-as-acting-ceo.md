OPAP has declared boss business official (CCO) Jan Karas will turn into the organization&#8217;s acting CEO, supplanting the active Damian Cope. 

Karas will accept obligations from 1 June until a changeless CEO is delegated, except for HR obligations, which will be done by agent CEO, Odysseas Christoforou. 

Cope declared his choice to step down as CEO of the Greek administrator in April yet, from 1 June, he will take up the job as counsel to the board, working with Sazka Group on global turn of events. 

Cope became OPAP CEO in June 2016 and recently held the situation of overseeing chief of Ladbrokes global arm, from 2012 to 2015. 

Karas took up his job as CCO in January, yet has been with OPAP in different jobs, for example, boss deals official, since January 2014. 

OPAP official administrator Kamil Ziegler stated: &#171;Personally, and in the interest of OPAPs Board of Directors, I might want to express gratitude toward Damian for his huge commitment to OPAPs progress and results and want him to enjoy all that life has to offer for what&#8217;s to come. 

&#171;I am anticipating working with him (Karas). I am persuaded we will accomplish our key objectives and address the difficulties emerging after the COVID-19 pandemic.&#187; 

With the Greek Government facilitating lockdown limitations, OPAP continued retail procedure on 11 May, which saw the administrators 3,750 stores start reviving, yet with severe social separating measures set up.
