I am enchanted that we have agreed with our key loaning banks on this changed RCF, which will give us further money related adaptability to proceed on our way of incredible development force. 

We stay very much put to exploit a scope of appealing development openings we accept will be accessible to us. 

GVC as of late anticipated its EBITDA could fall by 50m every month during the current coronavirus pandemic. 

This is down from the first determined 100m misfortune every month as the administrator keeps on executing alleviations to diminish the effect of the emergency.
