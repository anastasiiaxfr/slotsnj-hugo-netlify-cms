# PLAYMGM NJ REVIEW
Play MGM Casino, also known as BETMGM Casino, and is a relative newcomer to the online gambling scene of the New Jersey. It launched first in 2017, one of the few relatively new online casinos cropping up in the NJ.

However, the same can’t be said for its owner, MGM. Yes, the same MGM which took control of the Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa in 2016. That granted them a land-based casino in the Atlantic City, giving them a license to launch an online casino for players of the NJ.

While MGM is more active in Las Vegas, it recently decided to pay more attention, and divert more resources, to the state of New Jersey. Right now, PlayMGM Online is one of the five casinos operating under the Borgata gambling license, along with Borgata Online, Pala Casino, PartyCasino, and Scores. It is also one of the few NJ casinos to offer online gambling along with virtual poker and sportsbook. As such, PlayMGM shares player pool and progressive jackpots pool with its partners’ sites.

## PLAYMGM NJ SOFTWARE PLATFORM
PlayMGM, ever since its launch in July 2017, has used the sane trusty software platform used by other sites affiliated with Borgata Casinos. Its software provider is GVC Holdings, a well-known and experienced developer group.

PlayMGM Casino provides its players with three venues of accessing their games:

Downloadable client: players can directly download and install the casino’s client, granting them the full access to the functionality and games.
Browser-based client: you can also access this website through any modern browser, like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Safari.
Mobile app: a rather limited version of the casino is available for download for Android and iOS mobile devices. While the number of games is small, players can access the full functionality of their profile through the app.

## PLAYMGM APPLICATION
As it was already mentioned, the mobile app of PlayMGM Online is a rather limited version of the casino. Players only have access to the few games out of more than 220 that PlayMGM provides. There are four categories available:

 + Blackjack
 + Roulette
 + Video poker
 + Slots

All of those are represented, even if in small numbers. However, other than that, the app provides a stable connection on both WiFi and 4G, so there is no need to fear disconnection and loss of winnings. And, despite having small bugs here and there, this mobile app provides an enjoyable, if mediocre, experience to its users.

And, unlike some other online casinos, PlayMGM NJ offers mobile gaming on both Android and iOS, not just on Apple products. If you consider the current state of the app as a foundation of sorts, it would provide a good platform for growth and expansion in the future.

## PLAY MGM CASINO GAME CATALOG
PlayMGM Online Casino has a catalog encompassing almost 220 games. Those include 20 table games, 199 slots, and quite a few video poker tables. While it is not the greatest variety out of NJ casinos, PlayMGM falls firmly into the second league of the state’s online gambling.

The number of slots, while not the most impressive, is decent, and there are some progressive jackpot slots to spice things up. Table games, on the other hand, are limited, with only roulette, craps, Texas Hold’em, Bonus Poker, and three variants of blackjack.

## PLAYMGM REWARDS AND PROMOTIONS
In this part of the PlayMGM New Jersey review, we will tell you about bonus offers, daily bonuses, and the VIP program that PlayMGM has. 

Welcome bonus package provided to new players is one of the most generous among its competitors. There is a 100% match on the first deposit, for up to $1,000. This is one of the biggest matches in NJ.
However, there is a drawback: to get a clearance for a withdrawal, player must fulfill an x20 wagering requirement first. 

### DAILIES
There are following daily promotions that you will be able to claim:

$20 for 20: on Mondays, there is a chance for every player who logs in to win $20 in bonus money. It has an x20 wagering requirement. 
Power Play Wednesday: every Wednesday, you can make a deposit of minimum $25 to receive iReward Points (bonus points from PlayMGM Casino loyalty program, iRPs). You can later exchange iRPs for bonus cash. The maximum reward is $210 of bonus cash, by accumulating 5,000 iRPs, the minimum reward is $25, requiring 25 iRPs. As usual, there is an x20 playthrough requirement. You will need to opt-in to get that bonus.

Throwback Thursday: starting at 4 PM each Thursday, you can get a free slot spin each hour, for a maximum of five spins. To receive that bonus, you will need to be logged into your account and opt-in to the bonus offer.

You deposit, We raise: each Sunday, deposit $50 minimum to get an extra $10 in bonus cash. It has the same x20 wagering requirement. 

## PLAYMGM REWARDS VIP PROGRAM
PlayMGM took a VIP program format from Borgata Casino. It has loyalty tiers, bonus points called iReward Points, and similar points earning and redeeming options.

You can redeem earned points in three ways:

Use them to pay for commodities at the physical location of MGM Resort: you can book hotel rooms, eat at restaurants, and buy tickets to MGM shows.

Exchange them for the bonus cash to use them at both the online casino and poker sites. 

Buy merchandise and useful items from the online store.
As we’ve already mentioned, iRewards points allow players to raise from their tiers. The more points you earn, the higher is your tier, and the better are the benefits that you get. Here are tiers of the VIP program:

+ Sapphire (basic level)
+ Pearl (from 25,000 to 75,000 points)
+ Gold (from 75,000 to 200,000 points)
+ Platinum (from 200,000 points)
+ Noir (invitation only)

However, different games contribute different amounts of iReward points on wagers. Slots provide the best ratio, but they are also more volatile than other games.

Here is the rate at which you earn iRPs from each game:

+ $5 bet for 1 iRP on slots
+ $10 for 1 iRP on Progressive/Jackpot slots
+ $20 for 1 iRP on video poker
+ $25 for 1 iRP on Blackjack, Craps, and Roulette

While PlayMGM Casino created its loyalty program to attract more people and to give more incentives to play slots, it is not as geared towards high-rollers as many other programs. It has elements that will be used for casual players, as well as regular ones. As it allows to spend money on MGM properties and the online store, it will attract people who are willing to include travel in their gambling. Or maybe include gambling in their travel. For the more home-oriented people, there is an option to convert bonus points into bonus cash, which is not a bad deal. All in all, it is a loyalty program with good value.
