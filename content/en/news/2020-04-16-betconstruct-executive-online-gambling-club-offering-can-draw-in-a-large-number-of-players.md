He stated: &#171;Recent occasions have indicated us the world can change surprisingly fast and we should be prepared and adaptable enough to switch our business rules. 

&#171;Running an internet gaming business holds no risk to a current land setting. Unexpectedly, it offers the proprietor a chance to elevate their business to the more extensive masses, target more extensive player profiles and contact the individuals who dont have the chance to visit the physical casino.&#187; 

Mkrtchyan contends that in setting up an internet offering, land-based administrators can pull in &#171;a large number of players&#187; and &#171;amplify income&#187; something especially indispensable with many land-based gambling clubs incidentally shut. 

He stated: &#171;The direction of the episode proceeds with no supposition on to what extent it will take, so the main route for land-based club to proceed with their business and keep the benefit up is to move their activity online by either opening an online gambling club or utilizing a committed studio arrangement, or both. 

&#171;It is actually quite straightforward and quick.&#187;
