The online gambling market is enormous and growing every day. Globally, online gambling is an almost $50 billion industry, and it is expected to nearly double by 2024. It makes sense that you would want to get piece of that pie by gambling online in New Jersey.


But like all things on the internet, you have to be cautious when it comes to anteing up online. You don’t want to make a deposit at an online casino only to find out that the house won’t give you your winnings. That’s why you need to make sure that you’re not sinking your time and money into a New Jersey blacklisted online casino.

## WHAT CAN GET AN ONLINE CASINO BLACKLISTED?

One or more of these things can ensure that an online casino gets blacklisted:

 - Not following their own terms and conditions

 - Not paying winning players

 - Overly delayed 
 
 - Offering unfair games

 - Predatory terms and 
 
 - Spammy marketing

 - Not having a valid gaming license

 - False advertising

 - Outrageous wagering requirements


Of course, every blacklist is different, with different standards about what deserves blacklisting. But these are common markers of a shady online casino that has the potential to rip you off.

## BLACKLISTED ONLINE CASINOS TO AVOID AND WHY

### CYBERROCK ENTERTAINMENT N.V. CASINOS

CyberRock has a long history of paying its players slowly or not at all. Their terms and conditions are predatory, stating that if you make a deposit of $250 or less, the maximum payout you can claim is 10x your deposit. Plus, they have ridiculously low withdrawal caps and a 2 week-long authorization period for all withdrawals. The company is based in Curacao and has a reputation for being untrustworthy.


Their casinos include:

+ CASH O’ LOT CASINO 

+ CASINO FIZ

## AFFPOWER GROUP OF CASINOS

Affpower, also known as Game Tech, is a shady conglomeration of online casinos that are guilty of everything from dodgy advertising to pirated games. They have been blacklisted due to their reputation for being very slow to pay players—if they pay them at all. There is even evidence that they illegally hacked blogs and placed their advertising on the sites. Plus, they pirated Net Entertainment games and greatly increased the house advantage.

## CURGAM GROUP

The Curgam group is infamous for illegally buying or procuring email lists. They then send mountains of spam, advertisements, and malware to players’ inboxes. They also deny or ignore many withdrawal requests, so don’t count on getting any money from them.


Their blacklisted casinos are:


+ 99 SLOT MACHINES

+ MIGHTY SLOTS

+ PLENTY JACKPOTS

+ REAL VEGAS 

+ ONLINE SLOTLUV

## PRAGMATIC PLAY / TOPGAME / ENGAGE ENTERTAINMENT


This company has changed its name, rebranded, and been bought out many times, but they’re still blacklisted, regardless of what they call themselves. They frequently have complaints about slow payments, withdrawal limits, and frustratingly long authorization waits. If you have a question or a problem, their customer service is nearly impossible to reach and slow to act.
