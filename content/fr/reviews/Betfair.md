# BETFAIR NJ ONLINE CASINO REVIEW
We will start our review off with a little bit of history. Betfair NJ Online Casino was first launched alongside the first bunch of regulated NJ online casinos at the end of 2013. In the beginning, it was partnered with Trump Plaza, which is now defunct.

Originally, Betfair NJ casino hosted online poker games in addition to usual casino games, but they haven’t got much popularity and as such got closed pretty soon.

Nowadays Betfair NJ online casino along with Golden Nugget and recently emerged Play Sugar House consistently rack in more than $5 million monthly revenue. Betfair NJ’s’ bonuses, promotions, along with a great variety of games it offers have contributed to it becoming one of the top online casinos in NJ.

It should also be noted that Betfair NJ so far holds a record on the biggest prize payout out of all NJ online casinos. In 2015, a Union County man won $1,522,000 in Let It Ride. He placed $500 on each of three bets, along with an additional $500 on a bonus wager. That allowed him to win the maximum payoffs on each bet, along with the bonus by completing a royal flush.

## BETFAIR NJ CASINO HISTORY
The year of 2014 was a hard year for NJ gambling, as an economic downturn along with fierce competition from the neighboring states brought quite a few casinos down. Trump Plaza was one of those, permanently closing down, becoming the fourth casino calling bankruptcy in 2014. That was a major issue for Betfair NJ casino, as it was operating only because of its affiliation with Trump Plaza, as NJ state laws declare that every online casino should have an affiliation with a brick-and-mortar casino in NJ. For a time being, Betfair NJ casino in AC took shelter with Caesars Casino, but it was a stopgap solution to avoid closing down.

Still, in the end, that situation proved to be a blessing in disguise and Betfair NJ Casino reached an understanding with the Golden Nugget Casino, gaining their internet gaming license. Back then Golden Nugget had only started their growth and was really happy to embrace Betfair and its assets to increase their profits even more.

That lead Golden Nugget casino to pay more attention to the NJ gambling scene, leading to the greater cooperation between Betfair and Golden Nuggets, making it the undisputed leader in terms of market share. It holds that status to this day and has no intention of releasing it anytime soon.

## WHAT SOFTWARE DOES BETFAIR NJ USE
Betfair NJ casino is the only one that uses the software from GAN, formerly known as GameAccountNetwork. The results of this partnership can be easily seen: since the beginning of their cooperation, GAN has won Casino Platform Supplier of the Year Award twice, in 2015 and 2016. At the same time, Betfair NJ casino enjoys having a lot of high-quality games on their website. 

You can begin playing and betting in Betfair NJ online casino by simply navigating to their website and clicking on the game in question. Just make sure that you have an account with a deposit ready.

If everything is alright with your device’s OS you should just go to iTunes for the iOS app, or to the casino’s official site for the Android version. There, you will need to download the application and install. And, just like that, you are ready to partake in some gambling.

All in all, if you love slots, you will never get bored with the variety present here, not to mention that there are always developers adding new ones.

Still, with some casinos having more than 400 slots games alone, Betfair NJ online casino doesn’t look all that impressive in pure numbers. However, they compensate that in terms of exclusives that they have. To put it plainly, no other NJ casino has that many exclusive games in their catalog. There are 23 uniques slots for you to explore and enjoy, while the average casino has only 3 to 5 exclusive ones.

Pro version of blackjack offers quite a few interesting features, such as an ability to speed up the game through the turbo mode, bet up to five hands at the same time, and an ability to wager up to $10,000. 

### TABLE GAMES
As it was mentioned in our review before, Betfair NJ Online offers quite a few less conventional games to their players. Among those most definitely are games under the Table Games tab in the navigation panel. Here are some games that you will be able to find:

EZ Baccarat: Usually, in a baccarat game the deck is shuffled after every hand. This version, however, makes it so that the dealer plays out an eight-deck shoe and posts the results on a tracker. That allows you to track, analyze, and build your strategy further than before, so you don’t need to lean on luck so heavily. It also lets you place side bets on whether the banker will win with a three-card 7 or the player will win with a three-card 8.
Hi-Lo Solitaire: A famous time-killer game comes from our desktops and mobile devices to online casinos. Now you can liven it up a little by putting bets on your skills, to see if you can win it and get the money as well. All the satisfaction from solitaire with the excitement of gambling. 
### VIDEO POKER TABLES
Unlike some other casinos, Betfair NJ casino offers a video poker table for those lovers of this game. Working in cooperation with GameAccount Network, they’ve put a few different variations of poker on the site. Those include Deuces Wild, Jacks or Better, and Poker Bet.

Poker Bet is different from other video poker games, as its rules are following Texas Hold’em, rather than more popular draw poker. Other six poker games are typical for Game King that you can find in any other online casino. Nevertheless, they are still popular, despite being introduced more than 30 years ago.

### VIRTUAL SPORTS
Virtual sports are distinct from other casino games that online casinos have to offer. They are more akin to the amalgamation of other games, as they combine the thrill of betting on spot games with looks of a video game, and a random dash of luck and chance. 

Betfair NJ Casino employs such games as a way to infringe, just a little bit, on traditional sports games betting. Here, you can bet on a sporting or a racing event, and watch how the action goes from here via a digital live stream. 

You can put a wager starting from $2 to a maximum of $50. WIthout any lull in the action, contests are held each day, for all day, with an interval of 4 to 8 minutes.
