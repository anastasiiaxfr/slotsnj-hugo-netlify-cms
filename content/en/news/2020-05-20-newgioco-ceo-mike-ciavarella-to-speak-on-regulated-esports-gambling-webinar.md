While the financial aftermath from government-commanded stay-at-home requests has expanded from week to week, esports has becoming the dominant focal point as sports lovers search for substitutes to their amusement schedules. The board will investigate how this is influencing the business and on the off chance that it will cause change in the guideline of wagering on esports occasions. 

The online course is facilitated by Alex Igelman, Founder of Esports Capital Corp./Principal Co-Founder of Spectrum eSports Advisors and Gerold Libby, Partner at Zuber Lawler will be the arbitrator.
