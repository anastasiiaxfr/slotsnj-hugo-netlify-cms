At the point when we began, I was blonde (highlighting his silver hair) and 80 kilograms and take a gander at me now; this didnt occur without any forethought! 

&#171;Its silly to what extent it has taken. In any case, there is some uplifting news: at long last the auxiliary guideline was sent to Parliament. It is safe to say that we are there, at that point? Presumably not, in the event that you take a gander at the historical backdrop of past Dutch guideline. 

&#171;Despite the reality we thought all the political discussions finished in November a year ago, we have certain signs that we can anticipate a few firecrackers. 

&#171;They have political strategies to hinder the procedure. They can require a discussion and plan it for a while later. They can pose inquiries and that&#8217;s only the tip of the iceberg. 

&#171;But lets take a gander at it from the splendid side. On the off chance that everything goes easily, we ought to have execution of the enactment on 1 January 2021 and a market opening on 1 July 2021.&#187;
