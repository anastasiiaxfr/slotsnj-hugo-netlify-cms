Ocean Casino Resort, formerly known as Ocean Resort Casino has officially opened its doors in Atlantic City on June 28 of 2019. Only a month later, on July 10, they’ve started up their online gambling site, Ocean Online Casino. That marked the number of NJ online casinos closer to two dozens total.

As it is a newcomer to the scene, there isn’t much to tell both about the brick-and-mortar building, and about its online counterpart. It is in the early stages of building up its catalog, so there is no online poker rooms available just yet, though it is in plans for the future.

## OCEAN ONLINE CASINO NJ SOFTWARE
A software platform that hosts the casino has been developed and provided by GAN. GAN is a UK-based company with little representation in the US, though it did win the E-Gaming Review of North America’s Casino Platform of the Year Award in 2015 and 2016. Other than Ocean Online Casino, GAN is working with Betfair NJ.

The interface of the casino is smooth-working and aesthetically pleasing. It is easy and intuitive, with no need to guess where some or another option is. Even though the site is in its infancy, it works just as intended, though game selection is quite slim.

There are no generic loading screens, instead, the site uses animated movement across the screen to create a seemingly seamless transition.

As the casino uses Flash, it could be run on every browser and every system that supports modern browsers, like Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari.

## OCEAN ONLINE CASINO APPLICATION
Sadly, there is no dedicated mobile app for the casino. However, the mobile version of the site could be accessed from the mobile device. All modern mobile browsers can work with it to play games, make deposits and withdrawals, etc.

The mobile version’s interface is just as streamlined as the desktop version. Everything is adapted properly to reflect the smaller screen sizes of mobile devices, and menus are scaled and recreated to not have small fiddly buttons. However, the mobile version loses out on the visual appeal.

Players will find 36 games waiting for them on the mobile platforms. It is not a high number, compared to its competitors, and there are no real exclusives as far as we can tell. All in all, it requires a lot of work.

## OCEAN ONLINE CASINO GAME CATALOG
Ther are currently 72 games listed in the catalog of Ocean Online Casino NJ. Most of them are slots, several video poker titles and one table of each major table game. You can find the whole list of games here:

61 slot games
One table each in blackjack, roulette, and baccarat
Eight video poker titles
Among slots, there are nine exclusive games from AGT, adding to the prestige of the casino, though it is still not a high number. Those nine titles that you can only play in Ocean Online Casino are:

+ Roaring Reels
+ Big Prize Bubblegum
+ Winning Wolf
+ Eagle Bucks
+ Mustang Money
+ Sheer Magic
+ Grand Dragon
+ Money Heat
+ Safari Sprint

Since this casino is still in its first months, it is not surprising that there isn’t much in terms of variety and number of games available on the site. For starters, 61 slots and 11 table games are not so bad, and after they expand their selection, it will be good.

So far, there are no jackpots or In-Casino games, so expect progressive jackpot slots in the futures, along with more roulette and video poker varieties.

It is quite possible for them to also add a Live Dealer section of games, as there is a growing demand, and more and more casinos add them.

For now, Ocean Online Casino New Jersey uses games developed by AGT, IGT, Game King, and Spielo. There could be more software providers in the future, as they are expanding their catalog.

## SPORTSBOOK
The land-based Ocean Resort has opened its sportsbook and bar in July 2018, becoming the second physical one in Atlantic City – the first one being Borgata Casino. 

However, there is apparently some trouble with the launch of the online sportsbook, as it has yet to launch, despite the company’s partnership with William Hill, a British bookmaker running an online operation for Nevada and European players.

## OCEAN ONLINE CASINO BONUS CODE AND PROMOTIONS
Ocean Online Casino New Jersey offers a welcome bonus of $100 split over seven days. You also get a $25 voucher that you can redeem at the land-based Ocean Resorts Casino. You will get the first $10 right after you complete your registration. After that, you will need to wager the previous day’s amount one time to unlock the next step of the bonus. If you terminate it early or fail to bet for one day, then you will not receive a bonus for the next day, effectively forfeiting it.

This is the structure of the bonus:

+ Day 1 – $10 free slot play
+ Day 2 – $10 free table games
+ Day 3 – $10 free on all games
+ Day 4 – $10 free video poker
+ Day 5 – $10 free roulette
+ Day 6 – $25 free on all games
+ Day 7 – $25 free on all games
+ Day 8 – $25 free play at Ocean Casino in AC

There is an x30 wagering requirement for each bonus, meaning that you will need to wager $3,000 to complete that requirement and clear your winnings for withdrawal. 

## PROMOTIONS
There is also a sequential 100% deposit match that rounds up for $10,000! It is divided into 10 bonus steps that players will need to come over a week.

+ Bonus 1: Up to $100
+ Bonus 2: Up to $200
+ Bonus 3: Up to $350
+ Bonus 4: Up to $500
+ Bonus 5: Up to $750
+ Bonus 6: Up to $1,000
+ Bonus 7: Up to $1,250
+ Bonus 8: Up to $1,500
+ Bonus 9: Up to $1,850
+ Bonus 10: Up to $2,500

To unlock each day’s bonus, you will need to deposit a minimum of $10 during that day. If you miss a day, then the promotion ends. You can claim a minimum amount of $100 if you just deposit required $10, or you can go for the maximum, earning the full $10,000.

Each step has an x30 wagering requirement to fulfill so that you can withdraw your winnings. So, if you want to claim a $100, you will need to wager $3,000 first, before you can withdraw any.

Both this bonus and the welcome bonus have three rules that player will need to follow in order to get their winnings:

Any bets that are over $3 do not count for a bonus playthrough.
Safe or low-risk bets, if they are consistent, will void the promotion.
Different games have different contribution rates unless it is specified otherwise in the rules.
There are the contributions:

Slots contribute 100% from the wager
Roulette contributes 50% from the wager
Other table games contribute 10% from the wager
It is not surprising, or rare to see a contribution rule like this, as most other NJ online casinos have similar ones. Ocean Online Casino is not special in that way.

There are also special promotions in the casino, like small competitions for cash prizes and VIP suite week-long vacation. Those usually require a simple opt-in to participate and to play on slots and/or table games to take part. Each $1 of the wager is worth 1 point, and at the end of the month those points are tallied up, and the highest-scoring player will be awarded the prize.

Take note, however, that while the $1,000 in bonus cash will be deposited to your account automatically, you will need to contact the casino and exchange your bonus money for the hotel trip, should you want to. And if you spend any amount of it before the call, you will lose an opportunity to do so.
