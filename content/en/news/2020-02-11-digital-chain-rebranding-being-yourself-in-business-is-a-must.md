**Iryna Kurochkina, Founder and CEO of DC global showcasing office, considers rebranding as a business proclamation, its reasons, and the execution of rebranding her office from Digital Choo to Digital Chain.** 

DC&rsquo;s 2020 has begun in a significant radical manner &#8212; with a significant rebranding. The organization has changed its logo, personality, and trademark. We&rsquo;ve become Digital Chain; the achievement driven global showcasing organization that makes adaptable first rate arrangements and engages organizations to become Brands.

As energizing as it might appear, it despite everything caused numerous inquiries, for example, &lsquo;why rebrand if everything&rsquo;s alright as it is?&rsquo; Is it the need to play with innovative structures? Let&rsquo;s take an inside and out glance and sort out why and when rebranding is utilized as an important business instrument and what it really means.

**Being yourself.**

Being yourself in business is an absolute necessity. With the quick pace of digitalization, the high thickness of enlightening streams, and consistent association with others, comprehensively, individuals today can rapidly detect when something doesn&rsquo;t include and may lose trust in a brand. In reality as we know it where organizations succeed just when they become some portion of their clients&rsquo; way of life, the absence of trust is practically similar to a passing chime for any business and brand.

So, back to acting naturally. As far as organizations, the &lsquo;self&rsquo; is made bankrupt objectives, methodologies, and qualities. They give answers to the most significant inquiries, separately; &lsquo;what you are doing?&rsquo; This is the how, and why &#8212; which is the fundamental quintessence of your image. At that point watch the brand&rsquo;s inside and outer picture and ask yourself: does it convey no different things? Is it consistent?

**Are you being consistent with yourself?** 

In our case, rebranding turned into a sensible and regular activity. Since the dispatch in 2017, DC has become fundamentally both as far as individuals just as a specialist organization. We have built up a solid profoundly interweaved in-house foundation of administrations, accumulated extraordinary worldwide organizations as our customers, and made many honor winning efforts, remembering for the gaming business. At the same time searching for things imperative to us, things that interface us, we&rsquo;ve think of a reverberating arrangement of qualities &#8212; S.T.A.N.D. OUT, which joins sympathy, cooperation, responsibility, genuineness, and a success win approach combined with out-of-the-crate thinking.

We&rsquo;ve make considerable progress. Thinking back, it became clear how much we&rsquo;ve advanced and developed. With new amassed information, bits of knowledge, openings, and objectives, we needed to offer a strong expression regarding who we are to the whole business network world-wide.

Thus, Digital Chain was conceived &#8212; a declaration and demonstration of the organization&#8217;s inner advancement, our qualities and our S.T.A.N.D OUT way to deal with difficulties. Each bit of our new picture imparts our pith and what esteem we deliver to the world. Fluid metal is a key component of the restored style: an image of the agency&rsquo;s quality, adaptability, and versatility, the aptitudes and mastery that supplement the DNA chains of new solid brands we help to make. Other new corporate hues add to this way of thinking, with obvious white to speak to bravery, supreme opportunity of activity, virtue of thought, and the nonattendance of tumult in work forms. Rich dark mirrors our energy for investigating the substance and strong, certain means to vanquish the obscure. We are steady, proficient, with solid securities fashioned inside a group structure and with customers, who are dynamic yet adaptable in finding the ideal fit with regards to incorporating business-related solutions.

This is the thing that rebranding is tied in with coordinating brand pith with the brand picture, correspondence and activity. Expressing who you are noisy and away from to set the extension of trust with crowds, arrive at win-win results with accomplices, and make the most proficient answers for customers. In the event that that is the thing that your business endeavors, and in the event that the absence of consistency is really an issue, at that point yes &#8212; rebranding might be the solution.

**It could be an entirely different story, with you as the creator.** 

As for us, we at Digital Chain are extending our topographical inclusion to Asian and African markets, broadening our clients&rsquo; portfolio both in the specialty and standard classes. Another concentration for the not so distant future is adding to the advancement of an expert network worldwide by sharing our solid specialty aptitude. There are many energizing difficulties in progress, and we can&rsquo;t hold up to feature significantly increasingly striking activities of ours.
