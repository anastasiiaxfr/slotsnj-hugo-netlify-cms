**EveryMatrix is thrilled to announce the launch of RGS Matrix, the company&rsquo;s sixth iGaming standalone solution. RGS Matrix is an &ldquo;out of the box&rdquo; remote gaming server which aims to offer excellent player experiences, consistent deployment, and quicker content integration.**

The new product will be managed by Mathias Larsson, Managing Director at Spearhead Studios, EveryMatrix&rsquo;s recently launched gaming development studio. RGS Matrix powers slots, table games, and instant wins, and is currently certified for Malta, UK, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Sweden, Spain and Denmark.

With a modular platform architecture, the solution was designed to handle the traffic expected by Tier-1 iGaming operators and is continuously monitored by an experienced infrastructure team to provide optimal performance and security. RGS Matrix allows new games to be released with zero downtime and with no impact on existing deployment.

**Ebbe Groes, Group Chief Executive Officer & Co-founder**, said: _&ldquo;EveryMatrix aims to offer 360&deg; iGaming solutions to casino operators, and by enriching the offering with our own RGS Server, right after we&rsquo;ve launched into gaming development with Spearhead Studios, we aim to prove our partners that we&#8217;re up for the task of helping them build their casino operations from scratch in their desired target territories._

_&ldquo;RGS Matrix brings more than game development and deployment. The studios launching on our server will have a number of benefits, which include obtaining certifications in many countries, using our advanced gaming building framework to create spectacular new content or even add key features required by large operators, especially related to responsible gambling. Distribution as always is key, and I&rsquo;m happy to announce that we have several deals in the pipeline already. RGS Matrix is for all, not just for EveryMatrix casino clients!&rdquo;_

**Mathias Larsson, Managing Director at Spearhead Studios**, commented: _&#8220;RGS Matrix&#8217;s objective is to connect creative game developers with casino operators looking to enhance their content offering with new and original titles. EveryMatrix&#8217;s operators can leverage the content kept on the RGS to attract and retain players from all over the world while the gaming studios based here can find new distribution opportunities. I believe this will be a winning formula, and we are positive that RGS Matrix will soon become a very popular choice in the industry thanks to its vast capabilities.&#8221;_
