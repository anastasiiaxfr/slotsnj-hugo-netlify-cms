At ICE London 2020, _NJ Slots Online_ talked with **Mark Woollard** , Business Development Director at Pragmatic Solutions, about the companys way to deal with working with administrators and its advancement plans for 2020. 

**How fruitful was your ICE 2020?** 

It was generally excellent. We had many individuals coming up to the stand. A great deal of administrators were keen on the stage and a ton of engineers were keen on putting their substance on the stage. 

**How significant do you think occasions like these are for the business?** 

I think they are extremely significant, particularly for developing markets where possibly you dont have the contacts or associations as of now set up. For a stage systematic this, its exceptionally simple for individuals to simply look on a site and not really get all the data. For potential customers, having the option to take a gander at our stand and come up to us and ask what we do and how we can affect on their business is extremely significant. 

**How do you pull in and offer to potential customers in a room brimming with rivalry?** 

Our marking is clear and clean. We additionally have a relationship with Pragmatic Play through the IBID Group which possesses the two organizations. It truly helps that we are both here together. At that point were additionally clear in what we do. Were API based, particular and all the marking is extremely clear and brief. Rather than being over-muddled in what we are attempting to offer, even on a stand premise with the marking, were attempting to be exceptionally clear so when individuals come up to the stand they will comprehend what we do straight away. 

**What are the absolute most significant advancements youve found in Pragmatic Solutions over the previous year?** 

Weve been attempting to get our name out there in the market. As I referenced, we are claimed by a similar business as Pragmatic Play which has a colossal impression in the market, so our activity has been to tell individuals that Pragmatic Solutions is a different business run freely. We are attempting to tell our clients what we can do, how we can support them and the speed at which we can move. The previous year has been about mindfulness in the commercial center and the following year is tied in with attempting to sign those serious deals and get the administrators across to us. 

**Last year, you got UK affirmation for your foundation. How was this authorizing procedure?** 

The stage is entirely ready to go into new markets rapidly so it wasnt excessively troublesome. It is truly versatile to economic situations whether that be in the UK or somewhere else, and we have an incredible consistence group. Marry really done a great deal of work for GLI-19 which is the best quality level for stages across a wide range of business sectors, so in light of the fact that we had just done that procedure the UK was only an extra box ticking exercise for us. 

**How do you plan on having an effect on such a serious market as the UK?** 

We offer something altogether different on the grounds that we give administrators full command over their predetermination and what they do. When youre working with different stages you may need to take their gambling club item, their bingo item, their games and their live vendor. While we have those ideas from better places in the commercial center, we permit administrators to pick who they need to go with and afterward we coordinate. We dont put them into an inner guide where theyre rivaling our home items. 

Thats a genuine key contrast for a commercial center like the UK. On the off chance that you can control your contribution and make that extraordinary, for state the UK region versus Spanish domain, all on one framework, that just makes for a considerably more remarkable activity for an administrator. 

**Outside of the UK, what are the other key markets for Pragmatic Solutions in 2020?** 

Weve been focussed on investigating the US advertise. There is a major open door for the large US organizations to possess their own foundation. We really offer answers for clients where we installed them, we give them how great the stage is and afterward we give them the choice to purchase the source code which implies that they at that point possess their own case of the stage. We would then be able to help with preparing and help with refreshes. For the US advertise that appears to have been something that individuals are exceptionally inspired by. 

Obviously, the UK and Europe are significant spaces. One of our customers is 21.com and theyre clearly a serious European based business so we have a great deal of involvement in Maltese kind administrators. What we are attempting to do isn&#8217;t focus on one explicit market. We are available to all business sectors and can help encourage what administrators need to do. 

**What are the key difficulties confronting Pragmatic Solutions this year?** 

Platforms all in all are not commonly comprehended by many individuals. Indeed, even at ICE 2020 we were asked do I put my games on your foundation? That would be a RGS stage. Were a totally different contribution. Were a center PAM stage, a web based Gaming arrangement over everything like your back office, installments, and coordinating activities. That mindfulness despite everything should be raised. 

People dont essentially comprehend what a PAM stage is or how it can profit your business. We have to tell administrators why having one provider for your PAM and afterward incorporating with different outsider suppliers, for different things is the most ideal path forward. 

<span style="font-weight: bold;">What is the total center this year fro </span>**m an improvement point of view?** 

We are an extremely proactive business in that we need to stay aware of guidelines and what every domain requires from a stage, yet we generally work with customer guides. The absolute best criticism we have from our present customers is that they sense that they are building their own framework. When they put a solicitation in of what they need to see, we ensure we encourage it. Were not responsive. We dont see something available which could be that years best thing, coordinate it and afterward administrators miss out on assets. We respond to what administrators need and afterward we expand on that. 

Our 2020 guide will be directed by what our administrators need and what they see as the patterns. You dont need your foundation to mention to you what the patterns are; you are the administrator, you comprehend the players, so you disclose to us how you need to function and what you need to do. At that point we will do that for you rapidly.
