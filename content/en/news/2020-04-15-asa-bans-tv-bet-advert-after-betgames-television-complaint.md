BetGames.tv tested whether the cases were deluding and could be confirmed or proved. 

In reaction to the ASA, TVBet contested this point, as the site www.logincasino.org had in fact recorded the provider as number one. 

However, TVBet has now said it won&#8217;t utilize these cases in future adverts following the ASAs maintaining of the protest.

&#171;We told ASTOK Ltd t/a TVBet not to rehash the cases &#8216;The Biggest Jackpots&#8217; and &#8216;#1 Worlds Live-Games Provider&#8217; in their publicizing. 

&#171;We likewise revealed to them that, when making near cases in future, they ought to guarantee they had the option to prove them with narrative proof and guarantee claims were verifiable.&#187;
