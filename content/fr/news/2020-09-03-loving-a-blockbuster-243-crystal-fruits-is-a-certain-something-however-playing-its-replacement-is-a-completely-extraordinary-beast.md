How do you follow up a work of art? An intense inquiry the group at Tom Horn Gaming needed to respond in due order regarding themselves after they had chosen to make a continuation of its profoundly famous game 243 Crystal Fruits delivered in 2017. 

**An altogether extraordinary monster** 

Everything players have come to expect from a 243 Crystal Fruits sequel is present and accounted for in 243 Crystal Fruits Reversed, including a famous 243 Wild, exploding symbols and multipliers. But if you go into 243 Crystal Fruits Reversed expecting a repeat of the game from 2017, youâll be pleasantly surprised. As the name suggests, 243 Crystal Fruits Reversed shakes all your expectations as this video slot plays in a way that is significantly different from its predecessor.
