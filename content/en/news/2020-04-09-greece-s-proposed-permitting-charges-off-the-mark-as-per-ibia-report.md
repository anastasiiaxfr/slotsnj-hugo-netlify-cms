The IBIA report stated: The methodology proposed by the Greek experts comparable to authorizing expenses is off the mark with global standards. 

IBIA doesn&#8217;t accept the difficult authorizing expense proposed and high tax assessment in Greece will demonstrate effective in pulling in administrators or amplifying the buyers diverting to that advertise. 

There is a reasonable threat numerous buyers will keep on being pulled in to wagering items in other all the more monetarily worthwhile markets, invalidating Greek administrative markets.&#187;
