<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Swedish Gambling Authority (SGA) has dismissed Viral Interactive&rsquo;s application to add Ninja Casino to its current license.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Global Gaming, a promoting accomplice of Viral Interactive, had moved the Swedish Ninja Casino space to the organization, which holds a Swedish permit for business web based gaming.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Viral Interactive applied to add Ninja Casino to its different areas on the permit, yet considering the SGA&rsquo;s choice, Ninja Casino won&#8217;t have the option to dispatch on Viral Interactive&rsquo;s permit until further notification, albeit Viral can appeal.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Tobias Fagerlund, CEO of Global Gaming, stated: &#171;It is important that the Swedish Gambling Authority, after very nearly five months of thought, decides to dismiss Viral Interactive&rsquo;s application to include Ninjacasino.se.&#187;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Fagerlund at that point referenced SafeEnt, which was allowed an audit into the SGA&rsquo;s choice to renounce its permit for wagering and internet gaming in January.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Fagerlund included: &#171;The Swedish Gambling Authority &lsquo;s choice to repudiate SafeEnt&rsquo;s permit has not yet increased lawful power and can in this way not be utilized as an argument.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#171;It is evident to me there is a ton of notoriety in the Swedish Gambling Authority &lsquo;s choice and that the Swedish Gambling Authority keeps on settling on sketchy choices which as we would like to think need clear help in the legislation.&#187;</span>
