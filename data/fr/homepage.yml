  ##  ARE NJ CASINOS SECURE?

  As it happens, to be recognized as a legal online NJ casino, they need to follow rather strict and regimented regulations of the NJ Division of Gaming Enforcement. Basically, they need to be affiliated with a land-based NJ casino, only provide their services for people physically in NJ, and so on. So far, every known casino follows DGE directives, so you can rest assured that they are secured.
