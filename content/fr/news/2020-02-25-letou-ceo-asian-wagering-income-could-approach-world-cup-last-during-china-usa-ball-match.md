LeTou CEO Paul Fox thinks wagering income in Asia could be &#171;on a standard with the Fifa Football World Cup last&#187; if the Chinese men&#8217;s b-ball group plays the USA at the Tokyo Olympics this mid year. 

Two primary components influence Olympics wagering in Asia , as Fox clarifies. The first is the occasion being hung on the landmass and during an Asian time zone; the second is the reality it contains two of the most well known games for Asian bettors: football and ball. 

Of the two, Fox says ball could be the greatest draw particularly if the Chinese national mens group faces the US. 

The LeTou CEO tells _NJ Slots Online_ : &#171;With the up and coming Olympic Games occurring in an Asian time zone, we will expect gigantic traffic during the ball rivalry specifically. 

&#171;If the Chinese national group played the ritzy USA group then we could see income on a standard with the Fifa Football World Cup last. 

&#171;Time zones are constantly basic whatever the game, as live wagering makes up an enormous number of the wagers we get. We hope to get an a lot higher volume of wagers at Tokyo 2020 than we did at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio.&#187;
