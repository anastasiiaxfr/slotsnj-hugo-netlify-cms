# HARD ROCK CASINO NJ REVIEW
Hard Rock Casino in AC NJ most definitely started their new venture in the gambling scene with a bang: guitar smash, fireworks show, and much more were held on the official opening on June 28. The opening of its online project, however, was much quieter.

The Hard Rock Hotel & Casino is a new, fresh name for the Trump Taj Mahal that occupied this building before its closure in late 2016. After its bankruptcy, it was purchased, rebranded, and renovated, bringing to us a new land-based, and an online-based, casino.

You may have heard about the Taj Mahal. While it wasn’t the oldest casino, being founded in 1990, it was one of the richest and largest ones. And it was followed by a series of misfortunes financial issues, ownership changes, and bankruptcy proceedings.

However, it still held the title of being the top-grossing land-based casino in Atlantic City prior to the opening of Borgata Casino.

It was also among the first casinos to obtain an online gambling license from the state’s administration. Taj Mahal launched its first online casino, called Ultimate Casino, in November 2013, forging a partnership with Ultimate Gaming, a subsidiary of Las Vegas’ Station Casinos.

Despite having great success at the beginning, soon it began to lag behind its competitors in terms of revenue, finally falling solidly to the bottom of casino charts. Thus, by September 2014 Ultimate Gaming was forced to pull out due to payment issues, causing Ultimate Casino to shut down. Goodbye, sweet prince.
Trump Taj Mahal lasted until 2016 but ultimately closed as well, paving the road to a new competitor to the already established gambling giants of NJ.

## HARD ROCK CASINO ONLINE SOFTWARE
To hit off in a highly competitive scene that is an NJ online gambling, Hard Rock Casino will need to get a good and solid start. To do that, however, they will need a well-tested, good-working, and all-around impressive software platform. After all, can’t play games if they are not working.

To get high-quality software, Hard Rock decided to call for outside help, signing a partnership with Gaming Innovation Group to build a platform to host its online casino. With that deal now secured, it could also help to get more third-party developers, as Hard Rock can allow itself to spenf time and millions of dollars on the developing and polishing of their gambling site. Not to mention that there is a bevy of fairly famous online game developers out there. 

Speaking of those, Hard Rock recently entered into a partnership with NetEnt as well, proving that they are going to the competition at full-ready state. It might also be prudent of them to contact some more developer teams, like Gamesys, NYX, or maybe even GAN, as they seem to do great work. That will add more variety to their platform and will open more possibilities for growth.

That said, Hard Rock Casino Online NJ will need to provide its players with a few venues to access its games. The most traditional ways to do so are:

Browser-based client: the easiest and the most widespread way to open yourself to the public. Hard Rock will need to allow its players to play their games from every OS and platform out there, from Windows to Linux to Mac. As long as their browser allows the geolocation, and is up-to-date, players will be able to gamble to their hearts’ wishes. It will need to be compatible with the most popular browsers, including Safari, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Internet Explorer.

Mobile device: there is an opportunity for Hard Rock Casino to develop the most comprehensive mobile app in the online gambling sphere. That will allow it to take top positions from the current heavyweights. Players will need to access and download this app for their iOS and Android devices. 

## HARD ROCK CASINO APPLICATION
For now, there is no application to speak of, however, it should be obvious for Hard Rock Casino Online that in our day and age players should be able to access their games on the fly. Thus, there is a need to create a mobile version of the casino. It is also obvious that it should support both iOS and Android devices, as those are the most popular mobile OS.

It should also be noted, that Hard Rock will have an edge over their competitors if they decide to go for a full adaptation route for their games. Maybe even develop a separate catalog for desktop and mobile versions. After all, it is fairly common that most online casinos offer a slimmed-down version of their desktop catalog for the app.

If they manage to do that, Hard Rock Casino New Jersey will become the top player in the mobile gambling scene right off the bat, with other casinos forced to dedicate their resources in the mobile versions as well. And this will be good not only for the Hard Rock but for simple players as well, as more competition means more and better choice. So we will need to keep a close eye on the results here. 

## HARD ROCK CASINO NJ GAME CATALOG
Hard Rock Casino Online offers its players a diverse, if not particularly big, catalog. Dozens of slots, five video poker games, three blackjack tables, and eight other table games – players will find something to enjoy there.  

### SLOT GAME TERMINALS
So far, Hard Rock Casino doesn’t offer hundreds of online slots, unlike most of its competitors in the state of New Jersey. The most popular ones are already implemented, however, and there are plans to expand the catalog further.
To have a better reach, the casino will also need to develop progressive jackpot slots, and get slots from popular brands.

There is a list of the most popular slots that Hard Rock Casino NJ currently has:

Karaoke Party
Jimi Hendrix
Michael Jackson: King of Pop
Motorhead
Megadeath
Guns n’Roses
KISS
Elvis Top 20

Pimped

### VIDEO POKER GAMES
It is clear that Hard Rock Casino NJ plans to offer a large selection of video poker games in the future. To do that, they are laying the foundation at the moment, so that they could match other casinos’ catalogs. To do that, they will need to offer at least the basic titles:

Jacks or Better
Double Double Bonus Poker
Double Bonus Poker
Deuces Wild
Bonus Poker

### BLACKJACK
As blackjack is the staple of table games in the NJ casinos, Hard Rock will need to offer a wide variety of those as well. After all, some casinos in New Jersey offer almost a dozen tables. At least, Hard Rock will need to offer some basic blackjack games, like those:

Single Deck Blackjack
Multihand Blackjack
Atlantic City Blackjack

### OTHER GAMES
Along with adding the most popular categories, Hard Rock Casino New Jersey will want to spice things up to stay afloat. To do that, they will need to add more games, especially ones found in the brick-and-mortar casinos. 

It will also be prudent for them to add live dealer games, as they are becoming more and more popular lately. Here is a suggestion on what they should add:

Baccarat
Pai Gow Poker
Craps
Roulette
Keno
Bingo
Three Card Poker
Let It Ride

## HARD ROCK CASINO VIP PROGRAM
A comprehensive VIP program is something that every self-respecting online casino wanting to make their players more loyal should have. That means that Hard Rock Studio will need to have more than just interesting and creative games, but also a bonus points system with worthy rewards. So far, there is nothing to speak of, as Hard Rock Casino Online barely started out, but it needs to move, and fast, to capitalize on the interest that its entrance have brought to it.

As such, we should be on a lookout for interesting promotions, welcoming bonuses, and VIP rewards that will ensure that players not just go and play there, but will stay after that.
