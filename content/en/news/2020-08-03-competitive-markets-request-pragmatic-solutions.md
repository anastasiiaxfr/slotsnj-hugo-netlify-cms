Creating one without any preparation can take years and there is additionally no assurance for progress. There is additionally no natural incentive in PAM â it is possible that it does what it needs to do, in which case youâll have the option to concentrate on components that separate your business, or it doesnât do what it needs to do and itâll then square the entirety of your strategies. </p> âMany gaming operators facing issues with their existing core platform are weighing their options to either partner with a reliable platform provider or evaluating the most efficient way to set up a new business. The appeal of in-house development may allow operators to differentiate their offering in a crowded market and give more control over the development roadmap. Most operators that chose this route years ago did so for these reasons, but this approach was not sustainable over timeâ- says Ashley Lang, CEO of Pragmatic Solutions.The aforementioned seem cost-efficient, but the pressure on regulatory changes, as well as other product, operational and responsible gaming considerations, have been more difficult to overcome in time. Companies performing across multiple markets are subject to evolving requirements and, most importantly, have become âcommodity servicesâ, common to all operators in an area where in-house developmentis no longer the go-to option, as it acts as a distraction rather than a good use of resources.<div class="videoWrapper">

</div>As Ashley states, yesterdayâs technology and old-style business approaches may not be fit for todayâs business challenges, which is where Pragmatic Solutions chance stands, as its sole focus is on the core management tools building the technology support needed in any regulated gaming business.Pragmatic Solutions&#8217; technology stack is comprised of a Player Account Management (PAM) platform (player account, wallet, CRM tools, bonus management, payments administration, KYC, AML and fraud control tools), an Integration Hub for aggregating 3rd-party content and services, and a Content Management System (CMS) for powering client-facing websites, apps and retail interfaces. These systems and services are the heart of every gambling business and serve business requirements that are common to every gaming operator.Pragmatic&#8217;s edge relies on its flexible core that integrates leading payment and content vendors on a regular basis and performs any third-party integration within three weeks. Moreover, it focuses on its rules-based automation development to streamline operational processes that maximise revenue potential and the technical services that connect self-exclusion databases, verifying player identity, enforcing deposit and betting limits as well as monitoring AML and reduce fraud and deploy these solutions for its operator network. In addition, they accommodate the platform to local regulatory requirements addressing compliance aspects for their clients.
