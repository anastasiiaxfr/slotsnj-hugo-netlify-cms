The earliest versions od slot machines have appeared as early as the 19th century. During that time, bars of New York started to promote gambling machines with payouts of free drinks or other prizes chosen by the bar. Later, it came to the logical conclusion of having cash payouts, with Charles Fey from San Francisco creating a first modern-type slot machine. It was called “Liberty Bell” and had the three-reel display that is still a foundation for slots everywhere. The first electromechanical slot game was constructed only in 1963, taking roots in Las Vegas and creating a whole new layer in local casinos. And only now with the internet becoming almost all-encompassing, slot machines are getting a facelift in the more modern versions, inline slot games. Now most players have no need to go to the casino to enjoy their games.

## HOW TO KNOW WHICH SLOT GAME IS THE BEST FOR YOU?
Before we delve into how to play online slots, let’s talk about how you should find ones that would be better for you. Well, the first step would be to find a casino with lots of slots. That shouldn’t be a problem as there are almost no casinos, both online and brick-and-mortar, where slot games don’t form the majority of their catalog. Once you’ve done that, it is time to cross-check across a few different sites to see if there are the same games on other sites. The most popular games are usually shown at the top of the list, and the most reputable game providers usually sell their creations to several platforms. With that, you would know that you can trust this slot game. That is not to say that you can’t have a good time with less known slots. Sometimes you can find a well-made unique game that you wouldn’t be able to find anywhere else. To balance those choices and to see whether it would be worth your while to play there, here is a small checklist from us:

* Check if the game developer is trustworthy. The most famous and reliable are often mentioned in our reviews, so you can check them out and see if there are any familiar names.
* The casino offers bonuses for slots players.
* There are progressive and usual jackpots with big payouts available for you.

## DIFFERENT TYPES OF SLOTS
There are different types of slots out there, and while they operate on the same principle, they have their own twists. To avoid their players become confused, casinos label different types of slots on their sites. Those types include different styles, total payouts, and the likeliness of the win. With that, the player can choose what slot he wants to gamble with, and start playing.There are the variants of the game:

* Video Slots: the most common type, it incorporates flashy and colorful graphics with standard slots gameplay, bonus rounds, and animations to watch for. The backbone of the slot games section.
* Fruit Machines: the reimagination of classic slots machines of the old, this type banks on the sense of nostalgia and time-proofed fun. Added to that are modern mechanics, creating an immersive experience for many players.
* Progressive Jackpots: the most popular, if not the most numerous type of slot games. The main difference there is that Progressive games have a jackpot that increases the longer it is played, with payouts reaching truly massive sums. Some jackpots were well over $100,000, which means that lots of players will try their luck there.
* 3D Slots: the most recent type, it combines modern graphics and adds them to fruit machines, enhancing the already fun experience even further. It is also the most fast-paced type of slots.

## HOW DO I READ PAYOUT TABLES?
While having a fun time spinning on slots is a good thing, winning money would be even better. However, in order to have a shot at winning, you will need to know a few things about how to read and understand a payout table. The first thing to notice would be the payline, which is displayed by every game. As the payline sets the entire game, all combinations will start from left to right. In different types of slots you will have different winning combinations. Some will grant you a win for two matching images, while others will require all three. Additional payouts are possible for different combinations and different symbols. You can determine how much you will win by reading the payout table. Tables describe rates, combinations and the amount of winnings. So if you see a “15x” sum at the table, it means that you will receive 15 times the money you’ve bet. Depending on the game, you will either get cash or some free spins.

## ONLINE SLOTS – HOW TO PLAY
Slots are so popular for a variety of reasons. Those reasons include their availability, and good design and sound choices, but the most prevalent reason is how easy it is to actually play a slot. All you really need is to place at least a minimum bet (thankfully, online casinos wouldn’t allow you to bet for a below the minimum sum) and to press a button/make a spin. That’s it, you’ve got your game. However, sometimes it happens that people wouldn’t recognize that they’ve won, as all the flashy and bright elements make it a little bit confusing. To make sure, read the slot display from left to right, and see if there are at least two matching symbols to the left of the display. That would mean you win. Also, take note that the game will reset itself if a technical glitch or freeze happens.

## WITHDRAWING YOUR WINNINGS
A self-respecting online casino will make a withdraw process clear and easy task. The whole sum will be tabulated after which you can simply withdraw it on any of your bank accounts. However, if you win a big jackpot, or score a progressive prize, you will need to check in with the casino and the bank for the payout, as the withdrawal of large sums can have some differences. It should also be noted that in cases such as that, many casinos may require personal contact from you to make sure that your money will go where they belong. Before playing, make sure that you’ve read the rule, terms, and conditions to make things clearer.

## HOW RNG GODS AFFECT YOUR GAMES
The RNG, or Random Number Generator, is something that allows slots to operate impartially from dealers and their expectations. RNG programs generate a random number or a sequence of numbers to modulate what happens with the slot. As it is, it helps to negate possible predictions about the game results, assuring people that the game is fair and random. Before its development, fair play wasn’t guaranteed in any casino, as there always was a human factor. That being said, it is time for us to finish that short guide to slot games. Stay tuned for more games’ info.
