## AN OVERVIEW OF PALA ONLINE CASINO
Pala Casino started as a Resort and Spa established in California. Before the online casino industry in New Jersey took off, Pala requested for an iGaming license in NJ, and they were granted permission.

As stipulated by the NJ local regulations, Pala had to partner with a land-based operator in the locality before they could offer their online games to NJ residents. Subsequently, Pala partnered with and launched its online casino platform under Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa in Atlantic City.

By the end of 2014, the software for Pala casino was released. Following the authorization by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, the casino games were made available to NJ gamers under NJIGP 15-001 license number. This goes to show that every game you see on the Pala Casino website is fully complaint and regulated by the Casino Control Act in NJ.

The casino has a wide variety of games which consists of 200 game titles. This includes video poker, blackjack, craps, roulette, baccarat, and slots. What’s more, the casino boasts of a highly responsive and reliable website, which is available on both Android and iOS devices.

## PROMOTIONS AND WELCOME BONUSES
#### NO-DEPOSIT WELCOME BONUS

Online casinos always try to surpass each other by offering better “bonus stakes”, and Pala Casino is no different. They offer a no-deposit bonus to first-timers to attract more players. The fantastic thing about this bonus is that they are completely 100% free, and they do not require the player to deposit any money before trying out some of the thrilling real money casino games.

When you register an account with Pala Casino, you can get a $25 no deposit bonus. Once you are done with your account registration and verification, this fund is deposited automatically into your account.

However, you should note that this bonus fund has a 20x wagering requirement. Also, the different games don’t help you with clearing the fund at an equal rate.

As at 2016, wagers on craps don’t count towards bonus clearing at all
Slots add 100% of your bets
Meanwhile, other available games contribute 20%.
Nevertheless, you should utilize your bonus as soon as possible. This is because they expire 15 days after they are issued.

## FIRST DEPOSIT MATCH BONUS

Consequently, when you make your first deposit, a minimum of $10, you become eligible for another bonus. This is a match deposit bonus of 100% up to $500. Do you know what this means?

Simply put, this means that if you deposit $500, you’re going to receive a 100% match bonus of $100. But, if you deposit anything above $500, let’s say, $700, your bonus fund will be capped at a total of $500. 

What’s more, this match bonus has a wagering requirement of 10x. So, if you want to withdraw the $500 cap from your account, you need to place bets worth $5,000. Also, the game contribution rights which we discussed under no deposit bonus still applies.

This match bonus fund is deposited into your account immediately after your first deposit, but it also expires after 15 days. So, take note.

## DAILY PROMOTIONS

However, you should note that you are only eligible to win this bonus if you had made a deposit of $30 minimum 30 days prior to your win. You are only exempted from this rule if you won with your first free spin after registering on Pala Casino.

## PALA CASINO LOYALTY PROGRAM
The Pala Casino loyalty program is called Pala Privileges. Membership into this program is automatically granted when you register. As you play real money games, there are two different kinds of points you can earn. The first is the Status Pints (SP). Next, we have the Reward Points (RP).

## STATUS POINTS
The Status Points are used in ascertaining your loyalty level. They enable you to move up on the Privileges ladder. As a player attains higher levels, he/she is awarded exclusive milestone bonuses. This milestone has to be cleared within 30 days after approval.

Even more impressive, this VIP bonus only carry a wagering requirement of 1x. What this means is that if you receive $100 for an accumulated SP50,000, you are only required to be once ($100) in order to withdraw the cash.

You should also note that at the end of each month, the status points are returned back to zero. So, you can’t repeatedly claim milestone bonuses.

Also, the amount of points you get is dependent on the type of game you play:

Slots: For each $20 you wager, you get 20 to 86 points
Table Games: For each $20 you wager, you get 4 to 52 points
Video Poker: For each $20 you wager, you get 4 to 39 points

## REWARD POINTS
This differs from Status Points in the sense that they don’t have anything to do with moving up on the ladder. Rather, they are a form of currency in the Points Store of the Casino, enabling you to buy lucrative rewards. Casino bonuses are among the rewards you can purchase with RPs: for ever $1 of bonus cash, you have to exchange 5,000 RP.
