The Betting and Gaming Council (BGC) has asked the Welsh government to reevaluate its business rate alleviation to incorporate high road wagering shops, bingo lobbies and club, to assist them with adapting to the coronavirus. 

In a letter to Welsh fund serve Rebecca Evans, BGC CEO Michael Dugher cautioned that except if critical move is made to secure such organizations, in excess of 2,000 employments in the nation are in danger. 

In March, the UK government extended its business rates retail markdown to cover wagering shops, bingo corridors and club, which means they will get 100&percnt; business rate reliefs because of shutting their ways to stop the spread of the coronavirus. 

But that didnt apply to the reverted Welsh government, whos adaptation of the arrangement doesnt apply to wagering shops.

The business in Wales is in danger of experiencing a body blow which it might never recoup except if the Government in Cardiff acts. These 2,000 employments are dedicated people with bills to pay and families to think about. Their employments merit just as much as somebody doing likewise work in England.
