### THREE-CARD POKER

Three-card Poker is another variant of a game that has a higher than normal chance of paying out for your benefit. Unlike the variants that use typical sizes hands, this game is fast-paced, doesn’t require as much thought, and can allow the player to get into the game without a lot of expertise.

The reason that this game makes our list is that there is a very small edge in favor of the house. In most cases, this edge can be as small as 1.5%, so you have a very good shot at being able to take home some money.
