The coronavirus lockdown has offered ascend to football-related wagering extortion, remembering proof of regrettably organized counterparts for Ukraine toward the finish of March with illegal information sold on to bookmakers, who at that point offer wagering markets. 

Estimates of wagers put on these particular games, once in a while alluded to as &#8216;apparition games&#8217;, go upward of 100,000 ($124,000) and its revealed bookmakers more than likely paid out dominating wagers to game fixers before the extortion was figured it out. 

Four lower alliance Ukrainian clubs, including Berdyansk, utilized a Facebook stage to advance a cordial competition called the Azoz Cup. 

BetGenius supposedly provided information about the matches and bookmakers, for example, BetFred, BWin and 188bet among others all offered markets until it was uncovered the occasion end up being false.
