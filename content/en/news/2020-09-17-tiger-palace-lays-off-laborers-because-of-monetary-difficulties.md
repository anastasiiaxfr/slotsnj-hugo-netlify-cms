<span data-contrast="auto">Reportedly, the workers got an email from the administration, expressing their two-year contracts were ended and would not be reappointed. Budgetary challenges were refered to as the principle purpose for the cutbacks. The news stories expressed: The mail was sent to all the laborers without having any conversations or gatherings with the workers. The laborers contend that such activities are against theLabourAct. Moreover, the cutbacks apparently influenced just the Nepali representatives, while unfamiliar laborers proceeded with their agreement. </span><span data-ccp-props='{"134233117":true,"134233118":true,"201341983":0,"335559740":240}' />
