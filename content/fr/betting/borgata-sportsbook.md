excerpt: When many online sportsbooks advertise ‘risk free’ first bets, it can pay to double check the small print. What you’ll normally find is that you do get a refund if your first bet loses – though this is in bonus money or betting credits. That means you need to gamble with the money before it can be withdrawn, which is not how many people would define ‘risk free’.

## BONUS: $250 RISK FREE BET {#0-bonus-250-risk-free-bet}

When many online sportsbooks advertise risk free first bets, it can pay to double check the small print. What you’ll normally find is that you do get a refund if your first bet loses – though this is in bonus money or betting credits. That means you need to gamble with the money before it can be withdrawn, which is not how many people would define risk free.

## BONUS CODE FOR 2020 {#1-bonus-code-for-2020}

NJ SPORTSBOOK	| BORGATA SPORTS
-|-
Bonus Code | PLAYNJ
Bonus | $250 risk-free bet
Casino Bonus | $20 free
Last Updated | February 2020

At Borgata, your first bet is&nbsp;**truly risk-free**.

You will need to use our Borgata Sportsbook bonus code PLAYNJ on signup to qualify for either the free bet offer or no deposit casino bonus.

There are some simple rules to follow to claim this risk-free betting bonus:

  * <a href="/visit/borgata-sportsbook/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Register&nbsp;for an account</a>&nbsp;and make a deposit (see below for details).
  * **Place your first bet**&nbsp;of $25 or more. Your wager needs to be settled within seven days (so futures or season-long bets won’t work).
  * If your**&nbsp;first bet should lose**, you get a cash refund. This credit goes into your casino account, where you can withdraw or transfer it into your betting account.
  * The&nbsp;**maximum cash refund**&nbsp;is $250, and the minimum is $25.

In addition, new players get $20 free**in free play** at the Borgata online casino. Even if you don’t usually play online casino games, this is worth using because you never know when you might hit a big slot win.

### ONGOING BONUSES, PROMOS AT BORGATA SPORTS BETTING NJ {#2-ongoing-bonuses-promos-at-borgata-sports-betting-nj}

Compared to some other **New** **Jersey** sportsbooks, Borgata doesn’t have a long list of **player** **promotions** available. But what it does have is worth checking out.

In its app and website navigation, you will see a lightning-strike icon with “**Odds** **Boost**” next to it.

This feature is a boost in the odds of specific games and it changes depending on which sports are in-season. Some of these boosts are generous.

Even if Borgata is not your go-to sportsbook, it is worth keeping an eye on these. If you have decided to bet on the boosted match already, then the&nbsp;**enhanced** **odds** will give you more significant returns.

Other promotions include cash back on&nbsp;**in-play betting**. Again, the sports that feature this offer will change year-round.

Also, Borgata offers a&nbsp;**loyalty points program**.

Its online casino is eligible to collect points, which ties in with its live casino loyalty program. With the points you accumulate, you can redeem for hotel stays and live casino free play.

## HOW TO ACCESS THE BORGATA SPORTSBOOK IN NEW JERSEY {#3-how-to-access-the-borgata-sportsbook-in-new-jersey}

When you&nbsp;<a href="/visit/borgata-sportsbook/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">visit&nbsp;<strong>BorgataOnline.com</strong></a>, it will detect your device type and screen size. It will prompt you to download the app for your&nbsp;**Apple**&nbsp;or&nbsp;**Android**&nbsp;device. However, this is not mandatory; the desktop website will adjust to your screen size.

You can also access the site on a desktop computer. The main difference is that the website holds both the navigation menus (that come in on the left as you move through the site) and the screens showing the matches at the same time.

If you are using a mobile device, the app will give you a smoother overall experience.

Apps are also less prone to&nbsp;**geo-compliance**&nbsp;issues. These can occur when Borgata is unable to confirm your location, preventing you from placing bets.

## USING THE BORGATA SPORTS BETTING APP {#4-using-the-borgata-sports-betting-app}

The following section takes you through using Borgata’s app and website.

We cover the layout, where to find your account info, the list of sports and how to place a bet. Then we follow up with the sports you can bet on and the types of bets you can wager.

You can&nbsp;<a href="/visit/borgata-sportsbook/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">use this link to download Borgata</a>. Before you place a bet, you’ll need to make a deposit. We discuss this in-depth in the “**How-To**” section.

### NAVIGATING AROUND THE BORGATA ONLINE SPORTSBOOK {#5-navigating-around-the-borgata-online-sportsbook}

Borgata, with its technology partner,&nbsp;**GVC**, has used an icon-based navigation system for its app and website.

The key differences between them are that the bet slip is hidden until you use it, and more of the menus sit behind triple-bar icons to save space.

At the top of the site, you will see a&nbsp;**registration**&nbsp;**button**. Once you have registered and logged in, this will change to your account information, plus a link to the cashier.

There are also links to poker and casino apps.

You will then see a row of icons (a grid on the app). Each shows a ball, with the name of the sport alongside.

**Live betting&nbsp;**is first (more on that below), with the lightning-strike icon of the odds boost taking you to the promotions page. The list of sports will change, depending on which major leagues are in-season. More sports are available at the end of this list, where you will find an&nbsp;**A-Z list**, which brings up a new menu.

When you choose a sport, a new menu appears on the left. It will cover the screen for mobile users. Here, you will see the leagues and other bet options like futures, player props or special event markets.

Selecting these will populate the middle area of your screen with those markets.

It is the list of matches where you will locate your bets. The next (sometimes biggest) matchups are here. Some match days see a lot of action; we recommend using the search function here.

Matches have boxes next to the teams. These show the spread, moneyline and total bets only. If you click on the link next to each game, you’ll get a full list of bets. These depend on the sport, including props, period betting and specials.

Selecting the odds in those boxes will&nbsp;**populate your bet slip**, though it is not the end of the process.

You can add a lot of bets, then&nbsp;**organize**&nbsp;them into&nbsp;**parlays**&nbsp;and singles all at once.

Your bet slip is on the right, for desktop users, and will pop up on the mobile app. You need to set the amount of your bet and confirm it before your bet is live.

Other parts of the Borgata app show your&nbsp;**bet**&nbsp;**history**&nbsp;and any currently open bets.

## SPORTS OPTIONS AT BORGATA SPORTSBOOK {#6-sports-options-at-borgata-sportsbook}

Some New Jersey sportsbooks cover any and every sport from all around the world. Borgata has taken a different approach; instead of covering the more popular games, your options include&nbsp;**college**&nbsp;**sports**,&nbsp;**international**&nbsp;**leagues**&nbsp;and the most popular sports from outside of the US.

Here are the essential sports options:

  * **Baseball**
  * **Basketball**
  * **Boxing**
  * **Cricket**
  * **Football**
  * **Golf**
  * **Hockey**
  * **MMA**
  * **Motorsports**
  * **Soccer**
  * **Tennis**
  * **Rugby Union**

## TYPES OF ONLINE BETS AVAILABLE AT BORGATA SPORTSBOOK {#7-types-of-online-bets-available-at-borgata-sportsbook}

You can now place bets while games are underway, thanks to Borgata’s&nbsp;**live**&nbsp;**betting**&nbsp;feature.

This type of bet is heavily promoted across all of the NJ sports betting sites. You start enjoying betting while the action is underway; the extra interaction makes the matches a lot more enjoyable.

Live,&nbsp;**in-play bets**&nbsp;cover many of the standard bet types in the list below. You will see the odds update in real-time as the action unfolds, and you can place bets at any time.

The regular bet types can be divided into&nbsp;**singles**&nbsp;(betting on one match or outcome),&nbsp;**multiples**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**specials**&nbsp;like player props.

This list shows the key options:

  * **Moneyline**: This is first, as it is the primary single outcome bet. You’ll see a number with or without a minus sign, which shows how much you’d win for a $100 bet, or (with a minus) how much you need to wager to win $100. You don’t need to bet in $100 units.
  * **Spreads**: Here, Borgata will add points to the underdog, leveling the chances of both teams. Spreads are fractional to avoid tied outcomes. The odds for each team will be equal when you take the spreads into account.
  * **Totals**: This bet involves the total goals or points for the match. You’ll receive a number; you can wager on it being too low (the over) or too high (bet the under). This type of bet is also available for specific periods of a match.
  * **Parlays**: You can bet on many matches by linking them into a parlay. The profits from each will cascade onto the next game. This bet is a great way to win big from a small wager, though keep in mind that one selection losing will kill your parlay.
  * **Teasers**: This form of parlay includes spreads, giving you some margin of error for the selections. Naturally, the profits will be smaller than for a straight-up parlay.
  * **Round Robins**: This form of a multiple bet sees every team play against the others you selected. If one team loses, then the selections involving them are losers, though you still have a shot at profits from the other matchups.
  * **Player Props**: Also known as proposition bets, these are sport-specific. You are betting on the performance of players, for example, points scored by an individual in an&nbsp;**NBA**&nbsp;game.
  * **Period Betting or First Team to Score**: Again, these bets vary by sport. Quarter betting in football is an example. The first team or last team to score is also popular.
  * **Futures**: Many of the bets covered here can be for a full season. For example, you could bet on the conference winner or even the winner of the playoffs. Keep in mind that future bets keep your stake locked up for a long time.

## MAKING A DEPOSIT AT BORGATA SPORTSBOOK {#8-making-a-deposit-at-borgata-sportsbook}

There are a number of options available for making a deposit via the Borgata sports betting site or app.

These include using&nbsp;**credit or debit cards**,&nbsp;**Skrill**, **bank transfers**, **PayNearMe**, or a **Borgata-branded debit card**.

Bank transfers are via e-check (also called&nbsp;**ACH**&nbsp;deposits). To make these instantaneous, you will need to get separately verified by “**VIP Preferred**.” Once you confirm it, this is a fast and secure option for deposits and withdrawals.

Regular&nbsp;**Mastercard**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**Visa**&nbsp;cards work for deposits. By registering for a&nbsp;**Borgata Play+ card**, you can also withdraw funds. That card can be used as a regular debit card or at ATMs. If you are close to the&nbsp;**Boardwalk**, then the&nbsp;**cage**&nbsp;at Borgata Casino is also an option for deposits.

## RESPONSIBLE GAMING, CUSTOMER SUPPORT AT BORGATA ONLINE SPORTSBOOK IN NEW JERSEY {#9-responsible-gaming-customer-support-at-borgata-online-sportsbook-in-new-jersey}

All New Jersey online sportsbooks are required to have a measure to assist people with gambling problems.

You’ll find this information by clicking on the green&nbsp;**New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement**&nbsp;(NJDGE) badge at the top of Borgata’s website.

This link takes you to a page with multiple navigation options on the left, which includes a **questionnaire** to help assess you for potential gaming issues. There are also links to help organizations, and instructions for **setting betting limits**, deposit limits, taking a time-out or **self-excluding** from Borgata Sportsbook.

You have three methods to contact the Borgata customer service team if you cannot find the information you need in its detailed FAQ section. These are:

  * **Live chat**
  * **Telephone: 1-877-448-5833**
  * **Webform**

## WRAPPING UP: HOW DOES BORGATA SPORTSBOOK IN NJ COMPARE? {#10-wrapping-up-how-does-borgata-sportsbook-in-nj-compare}

The Borgata is one of the most iconic AC casinos and was among the first to open a live sportsbook. While its app and website initially lacked some of the functionality of its rivals (for example, in-play betting), Borgata has caught up. This site has intuitive icon-based navigation and offers lines on all the major sports.

Check out the&nbsp;**risk-free bet of up to $250**, which is a great way to get your betting bankroll off to a positive start.
