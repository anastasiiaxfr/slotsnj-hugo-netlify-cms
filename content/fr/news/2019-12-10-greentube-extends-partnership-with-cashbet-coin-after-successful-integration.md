Greentube, a subsidiary and part of NOVOMATIC Interactive division, has partnered with CashBet Coin to offer CBC cryptocurrency as a payment method across its B2C social casinos.

The deal comes after a successful integration with Greentube&rsquo;s flagship social platform, GameTwist, one of the world&rsquo;s largest online gaming communities, and allows customers to purchase credits using CBC across its collection of over 400 casino games.

Greentube has started integrating CBC and its underlying blockchain technology throughout the company portfolio, offering an alternative way for users to play its award-winning online slots, casino, card games and bingo content. With a strong foothold in Europe, CBC will be accepted in all markets where GameTwist operates.

**Ronald van den Brink, Greentube CCO**, said: &ldquo;This partnership with CBC marks the next stage in Greentube&rsquo;s strategy to leverage blockchain solutions to improve the customer experience. The technical excellence, demonstrable utility, and versatility of CBC perfectly aligns with our vision for cryptocurrency in social gaming. The first step has been to offer our players a new cryptocurrency payment option, and we have big plans to develop CBC further across our social casino brands.&rdquo;

**Ed Brennan, President at CashBet Coin,** said: &ldquo;We are rapidly establishing CBC as the go-to cryptocurrency for iGaming markets all over the world. Our partnership with Greentube and its social casinos underlines the demand for alternative payment methods such as CBC and proves the advantages our technology can bring to social casino gaming.&rdquo;
