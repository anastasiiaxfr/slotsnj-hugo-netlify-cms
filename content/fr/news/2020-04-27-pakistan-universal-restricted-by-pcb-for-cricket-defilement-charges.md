The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has prohibited batsman Umar Akmal from all types of the game for a long time, after he neglected to report degenerate match-fixing draws near. 

The Pakistan global was temporarily suspended in February, officially accused of two breaks of the PCBs hostile to defilement code, under Article 2.4.4 

The Article expects players to report any methodologies made to participate in degenerate practices to the PCB Vigilance and Security Department, immediately; yet he was administered to have neglected to report such commitment on two separate events. 

Earlier this month, Akmal ruled against challenging the charges, therefore viably tolerating the charges forced by the disciplinary board director, Justice Fazal-e-Miran Chauhan. 

PCB executive of hostile to debasement and security, Asif Mahmood, stated: &#171;The PCB doesnt enjoy any observing a promising worldwide cricketer being pronounced ineligible for a long time on defilement accusations, yet this is by and by an opportune suggestion to all who figure they can escape by penetrating the counter debasement code. 

&#171;The enemy of debasement unit normally holds instruction classes and supplemental classes at all levels to help every single proficient cricketer to remember their commitments and duties. Furthermore, and, after its all said and done, if a few cricketers choose to assume control over the code, this is the way things will work out. 

The batsman has played multiple times for Pakistan across three arrangements of the game, last highlighting in October 2019, his 84th T20 International appearance; he had as of late been in and out of the side because of a few disciplinary issues.
