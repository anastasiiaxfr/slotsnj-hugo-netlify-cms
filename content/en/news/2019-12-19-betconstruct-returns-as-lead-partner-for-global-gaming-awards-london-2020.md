BetConstruct will return as Lead Partner for the Global Gaming Awards London 2020, after an effective 2019 ceremony.

The Awards are presently in their third year and will see organizations fight it out in 16 classes, during an evening tea service on 3 February at the Hippodrome Casino.

BetConstruct, a main games wagering and gaming provider, returns as the event’s Lead Partner for this version, following last year’s paramount event.

It as of late went into a consent to give live gambling club games to Parimatch, just as getting a live vendor permit in Malta, and has huge designs for the US showcase in 2020 and beyond.

BetConstruct Founder and CEO Vigen Badalyan stated: “BetConstruct is charmed to be Lead Partner of the Global Gaming Awards London once again.

“Last year’s service was a colossal achievement and demonstrated how esteemed the Awards are inside our industry.”

Julian Perry, _SlotsNJ_ COO, stated: “It is the greatest social occasion of CEOs in Europe, so it’s awesome BetConstruct saw it the principal year and needed to come back.

“We are truly satisfied to see them return and we anticipate seeing them at the Global Gaming Awards.”

The Awards are fueled by _SlotsNJ_ and will include probably the most renowned and persuasive organizations in our sector.
