Delaware earned $160,000 in February sports wagering income, a year-on-year improvement of 621&percnt;. 

However, income dropped impressively from January when the state took in $1.5m, driven by Super Bowl betting. 

The Delaware Lottery runs sports wagering in the Diamond State. 

Delaware Park drove the path with $97,000 in income, far outpacing second-place Harrington Raceway, which took in $35,000. 

Meanwhile, Dover Downs earned $28,000, with Delaware on pace for a solid spring until the coronavirus pandemic shut down the countries gambling clubs.
