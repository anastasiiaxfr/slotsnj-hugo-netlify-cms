about_project: "The Virgin brand has been involved with a lot of things over the years, so their introduction into gambling was always bound to happen. When you look at NJ online casino reviews, you might realize that there are not a ton deposit bonuses or promotions all the time. However, that is the only weakness of the website as you can find a huge selection of slots, table games, and more. This is a very flashy and sleek site that operates out of New Jersey and will likely entice most players for a while."

According to the law of the New Jersey State, which is enforced by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, or DGE for short, each online casino should be associated with an operating physical casino in Atlantic City. Virgin Casino is not an exception, as it is affiliated with the Tropicana Casino and Resort, along with another site, that will get a separate review.

The European version of the casino was opened in 2004 and is accessible for citizens of the UK and Ireland. It has all the same things that make Virgin online casino so attractive – it is a fun place with lots of options to play with. As with the Virgin NJ casino, it has good promotions and bonuses attracting the clientele.

Virgin NJ online casino opened in 2013, two months later than its sister site, TropicanaCasino.com. As both those sites were developed by the same company, Gamesys, Ltd., they share a lot of similarities between them, both in the structure and content. However, they are not linked to each other, and Virgin bonus codes, promotions, and Virgin rewards are separate from those of Tropicana.

## TROPICANA CASINO AND RESORT IN ATLANTIC CITY

As Virgin online casino in AC NJ is associated with the Tropicana Casino and Resort in Atlantic City, it is only fair that we talk a little about it. Despite having some issues during the time it’s been active, like any other casino, it is doing well for the last few years and continues to do so. 

As is befitting of a casino complex, Tropicana offers to its visitors more than just gambling. It is a full-blown resort, with entertainment, dining, and shopping section called The Quarter. Not only that, but it contains a fitness facility called AtlantiCare LifeCenter on its grounds. The prestige and a long history of Tropicana (it celebrated its 35th anniversary in 2016) contribute to the confidence and trust that players show to Virgin casino.

## VIRGIN CASINO MOBILE APPLICATION

As any modern online gambling service, Virgin casino offers mobile users an opportunity to partake in the gambling. It has two apps, for Android, and Apple iOS users. For Android devices, you can download the app from the casino’s official site, VirginCasino.com, and for iOS devices, you will find the app on the Apple app store.

Strangely, it appears that the official Virgin online casino site doesn’t have any information about the mobile devices support. Also, keep in mind that the older devices and less common OS might not be supported.

That information is also missing from the Virgin online site, so, unless you are experienced with mobile applications and mobile gambling, you might need extensive help from the casino customer support.

Besides difficulties and platform support, our Virgin NJ review looks at the variety of games. After all, it would not do for you to set it all up only to get bored in an hour. 

That to say, there are no problems with variety here. The mobile version holds 180 slots, 6 poker games, six blackjack games, one roulette, and one keno. You can choose whether you want to play with real money, or for free. You can also set up your account and manage your money through the app.

Mobile apps, as well as the desktop Virgin online casino version, are secure. Owners of the site are very serious about protecting their players’ accounts and supporting their site’s integrity.

#### VIRGIN CASINO PLAY ONLINE – WHAT IT HAS TO OFFER

At the very beginning, Virgin online casino couldn’t offer much in terms of variety, as it offered only 76 games.
However, now the number of games significantly expanded – up to 243 of them, even if most of those are slots – 216. So far, there is no online poker table, though there are various blackjack games.

The game selection is not at all different from its sister site, Tropicana Casino, even though there is no cross-play between those. 

Betting options are varied and adapted for a wide range of players. If you are not comfortable yet to play with your real money, you can always play a demo mode with play-money. 

With slots being prevalent, they differ a lot in variety. While most of them are typical 5-reel video slots with 20 paylines, Virgin online casino offers two progressive jackpot slots. One of them, Wonderland, has 100 paylines and four bonus games. Another, Diamond Bonanza is a much more simple game with only 5 of them.

It was already mentioned that there is a variety of blackjack games, but Virgin casino also offers a plethora of roulettes, as well as 90 Ball Bingo. It should be noted, that only two other online casinos offer this game in NJ, one of those being its sister site.

## VIRGIN ONLINE CASINO NJ SOFTWARE

Virgin NJ Casino, as well as Tropicana Casino, are using Gamesys software for their sites. Gamesys is a European company, based in London. While it doesn’t have a major representation in the US, it has a long history of developing sites and games for online casinos. Since its founding in 2001, Gamesys has developed gaming platforms for many online casinos, like Caesars Casino and Jackpotjoy, not to mention the UK-based version of Virgin online casino. Most of the games that you will find mentioned in this Virgin online review are developed specifically for the NJ-version of the casino, so they are unique. 

 However, lately, Virgin casino decided

 to expand using sot from top US-based companies, like NetEnt and IGT. Since those companies are familiar to the US player, games that they offer are also much more common in other casinos. 

This is a boon for those players unwilling to try games from the Gamesys, despite it being a legit and reputable company. Not only that, but it offers a better variety of gambling choices for the casino’s clients, which is always great. It allows even the more experienced players to enjoy this relatively small casino without being bored.

Virgin online NJ casino is a fully online, browser-based gambling site. As such, you can safely enjoy it on any Windows or Mac computer or laptop. That means that you will have easy and reliable access to every available game without a need to use any specific platform or OS.

Or, as it was mentioned above, you can use a mobile device to access the gambling. It allows for greater access and mobility, even though at the cost of the less universal platform, as well as a lesser variability in terms of games.

## VIRGIN BONUS CODES AND PROMOTIONS

VIRGIN BONUS CODE: BEST BONUSES FOR VIRGIN NJ CASINO
Unlike some online casinos, Virgin casino offers plenty of bonuses and promotions. In fact, such offers appear right after your registration! And they don’t stop coming, as long as you stay as a regular player. There are daily, weekly and monthly offers.

What’s more, most of Virgin online promo codes are available to every player, not only those willing to place high bets. It should also be noted, that starting bonuses for Virgin online casino and Tropicana are the same, but short-terms are different, so be careful if you play at both.

### VIRGIN CASINO CASHBACK ON THE FIRST DEPOSIT

While most online casinos offer welcome bonuses to their new players, usually in the form of a percentage match of their first deposit, Virgin NJ Casino offers a different bonus. There, new players get a cashback ranging from $10 to $100, depending on their net losses. 

During the first seven days, in the case that you lose, Virgin online casino will cover the losses in the form of cashback. It is valid in any game, and you can withdraw your refund without any further wagering.

Of course, if you win, then there will be no bonus for you from the casino. Still, that risk-covering bonus is a good offer for any player, whether they are a novice or a veteran.

## OTHER VIRGIN CASINO NJ PROMOTIONS

### FREE SPINS
Every day you can make a free spin on one of the two slot games, to try and win more free spins. You can do that in Tiki’s Catch of the Day and Search for the Phoenix. To learn more details, refer to the Virgin Casino website.

### COMMUNITY JACKPOTS
In every game for real money, there is a possibility to gain a special code in the bar above the game. Using that code, you can unlock one of the four special Virgin rewards jackpots: $500, $1,000, $5,000 and $10,000.

Even after one of the jackpots has been won, it is replenished, so you can try for it again. Nut what makes it a community jackpot, however, is the fact that even if someone else won it, as long as you’ve played in the range of an hour of this win, you will get a share. That makes it a win not only for one player but also for those playing this type of game. 

### FRIEND REFERRAL BONUS
This is probably the easiest way to get Virgin rewards: just refer this casino to your friends.

You will get a $50 bonus for every person that goes by your referral and plays. While you can’t withdraw the bonus itself, you can spend it in 30 days on any game you want. Not only that, but your friend will get a small bonus of $10 as well. 

### SHORT-TERM VIRGIN PROMO CODES AND BONUSES
No Virgin NJ online review will be completed without mentioning little short-term promotions. In order to not miss them, you will need to check the official website often. This time, Virgin rewards are not limited to cash and spins. You can win anything from the high-costing vacation on some small paradise resort to the drawing from some aspiring artist. Of course, there are also more standard rewards, such as bonus dollars, Virgin discount codes, and some V*Points (more on them later).
Even then, there are some drawbacks to those little promotions. The number of prises is usually really limited, leaving most of the participating players without a prize (even a consolating one). No to mention that there are lots of non-withdrawable prizes, so you can’t just take them and use at your own leisure, even if you win. With that in mind, you should decide for yourself whether it would be worth your while. 

### POINTS VIRGIN REWARDS
V*Points is basically a reward point system set up by Virgin Casino for their players. You can earn those points by betting, with different bets on different games qualifying as one point, and through special short-time offers. One V*Point will be a $15 on 90 Ball Bingo, $40 on slots or $100 on any other game.

As soon as you get at least 20 of them, you can exchange them for bonus dollars. Right now the rate is 1 cent for 1 V*Point. While the bonus money are not withdrawable by themselves, you can spend them within 30 days to withdraw possible winnings. You also can’t convert them to play at the Tropicana Casino and Resort.  

### THE VIP SYSTEM
For any player that achieves VIP status, Virgin Casino in AC NJ offers additional bonuses and rewards. Those include enhancement of ongoing Virgin promotions, personalized gifts from the casino, dedicated VIP support team, tickets to shows and sports events, as well as vacations to the brick-and-mortar Tropicana Casino and Resort in Atlantic City, along with all of its facilities.

With that, we can conclude our Virgin online NJ review. We hope that it was informative and useful for you. Please, check other reviews of NJ online casinos from us.
