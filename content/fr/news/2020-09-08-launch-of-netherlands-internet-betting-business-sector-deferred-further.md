Minister for Legal Protection of the Ministry of Justice and Security,â¯Sander Dekker, said the Remote Gambling Act (KOA) will confront further postponements, likely happening on 1 March 2021. The balanced date is a while later than the past one.<span data-ccp-props="{" /> 

In request to <span data-contrast="auto">properly dispatch the managed market, the Dutch administrative body </span><span data-contrast="auto">Kansspelautoriteit <strong />(KSA) should check and affirm online operational licenses, which could take around a half year after the KOA becomes effective. </span>

The pushback on the demonstration additionally implies the entire cycle will be postponed too, with 1 September the assessed date the market will open, rather than the past 1 July date. KSA works with controllers in Malta to guarantee legitimate management of web based betting.<span data-ccp-props="{" /> 

<span data-contrast="auto">KOA was postponed in November of a year ago, and a large portion of a year later Dekker expressed in June that another pushback was likely, generally because of the limitations during the pandemic. He additionally stated, This makes more space for all gatherings required to plan for the new law happening. </span>
