Another option for the games at casinos with best odds is roulette. Much like Blackjack, this game is unique because the person that is in charge of setting the game in motion can have no impact on the outcome. Thus, it is a game of pure luck that the casino gets no edge in, but you still receive variable odds based on how you bet.

Roulette has its roots in France, with its prototype being created by Blaise Pascal himself. Almost a century later, it started to grow in popularity all over the country, and then beyond. Thus, a failed physical experiment turned out to produce one of the most famous and widespread casino games in the world.

### BIG MONEY ON THE STAKE

As roulette is a popular and widespread casino game, it has a reason for being its popularity: it offers a higher hold percentage than almost all other casino games.

There was a research from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, that showed that roulette games generally held more money than any other table game, including 21, Baccarat, and Craps.

There are a few explanations for that. The first one would be that roulette has a higher house advantage in-build in games. On average, it is around 5.26%, much higher than blackjack, craps, or even poker.

The second explanation would be that roulette better than any other casino game exemplifies the gambler’s fallacy. It is a logical fallacy that clearly demonstrates why casinos are so profitable, as it is the cause of many illogical gambling practices and rituals that many gamblers have. For example, if their bet on Black fails, they will double that bet on Black next time.

### ONLINE ROULETTE – WHAT IS IT AND HOW SHOULD I PLAY IT?

The roulette is a fairly simple game to play and master. It is this simplicity that makes roulette one of the most popular casino games.

There are a few different variations of roulettes, the most notable differences are between European and American versions. However, all of them have the same principle: no matter how many wheels are there, what payouts players get, or how much zeroes are there on the wheel, roulette is the game where players win when the ball lands on a number/color that they’ve wagered on.

With how simple it is, the majority of players learn it by getting hands-on experience. Players can always place either the marker or a casino chip directly on the felt and see for themselves how roulette and betting operate here. Markers are also called “lammers” by experienced players, so don’t be confused if you hear that word while playing. Lammers are provided by the casino, they look similar to chips, and they are made in different colors so that players can tell at a glance who made what bet. Players can assign pretty much any value to their markers, as long as they tell the croupier about it. After the payout, players will get lammers of their color, which they can exchange for casino chips at croupier. There are most common payouts on different bets that you can make on roulette:

* Exact number: 35-1
* Color (red or black): 1-1 Even or Odd: 1-1
* Thirds / column: 2-1

### DO TELL ME THE 

Due to its nature and the principles of its work, roulette has a house advantage of about 5.26%, meaning that for every $100 that player bets, they will get $94.74 in return. Hold percentage is significantly higher, though, as it requires a lot of time and good money to beat the casino in this game. However, roulette allows players to win multiples of their bet at times, for up to 35 times the initial wager. Players can also lose their winnings just as fast, though. All in all, even among other table games in casinos, roulette is one of the less player-friendly ones, as its winning margin is lesser than any other such game. It should also be noted that the player’s disadvantage is evenly spread on every slot, with every bet having the same negative expected value as others.

### ALL ABOUT THAT HOUSE EDGE

Instead of going on tangents of controlling the roulette game, or stacking odds in your favor, let’s establish one thing: the only way that you can legally improve your chance at winning in roulette is to play a more favorable version of the game. The simplest choice for that would be European Roulette, as it features only one zero, instead of two zeroes of the American version. For more advanced players, it might be better to look at multi-wheel versions, as those have generally higher return rates. Why would zero be a problem, would you ask? Simple: more slots on the wheel means a smaller chance of the ball to fall on your chosen sector. Meaning that American roulettes with two zeroes have a higher house advantage: 5.26% against 2.7%. In comparison, there is a triple zero roulette variant, called Sand Roulette. It has 7.7% of a house advantage. Meaning that you really shouldn’t play triple zero wheels unless you are looking to play them specifically. While it is obvious to hardened players and those who remember about relativity, we feel it prudent to point out that previous results are not affecting the next spin of the wheel.No matter how many spins there was, odds remain the same. And as we told you about the legal part of controlling the house edge and the field, let’s mention that there are, obviously, some which are less than legal. One of the oldest among them is finding some fault in the wheel, and taking advantage of it. That is called “wheel bias”, and was prevalent in a time when roulette wheels were manufactured by hand and without modern extra precision. That allowed some players to notice and exploit those flaws. Modern processes of roulette wheels creation, however, allow for an almost computer-like precision, almost fully negating wheel bias, and removing a choice to use it to player’s advantage.

### PAY ATTENTION TO THE GAME

While finding the best version of the game is a good enough start, there are some more things that you can do when you play. While croupier is the one who keeps everything in order and makes sure that the game would progress smoothly, it always pays to check your own actions. While roulette is the one game that relies the heaviest on luck (among other table games, of course), you shouldn’t hesitate to speak up and ask a croupier to clarify or repeat something should you have difficulties. After all, you are playing with your money, and you shouldn’t take them lightly. Keep your chips and lammers orderly, so that they wouldn’t be in one haphazard pile. It helps you to play easier, and it helps the casino to make sure that there is no foul play. Lammers is definitely something that you should have. They are easier to carry than chips, and you can set their price on your own. However as players get lammers of a unique color, you shouldn’t touch anyone’s lammers, or should you let other people touch yours. That will minimize possible confusion. It also should be noted, that if two or more players are placing their bet on the same slot, lammers (or chips) should be stacked vertically, so that it would be neater and easier to place. With these advices in hand, you are free to try and play roulette on your own! Or you can read about other games on our site.
