Mohegan Sun Casino NJ came to the NJ gambling scene among the second wave of gambling sites opening in 2015. It shares its gambling license with Resorts Casino and PokerStars, forming an impromptu coalition between the three. All of them are affiliated with the land-based Resorts Casino Hotel in the Garden State. It is a respected establishment with a long history, founded in 1978 as the first legal casino outside of Nevada, and keeping it afloat even through the hardest years for the NJ gambling sphere.

Those hard years were one of the main reasons why Resorts signed a partnership deal with Mohegan Sun Casino, a Connecticut tribal casino complex.

That partnership was mutually beneficial: Mohegan was able to enter the NJ gambling scene, while Resorts was able to rebound, and started to grow once again. Both of the launched their own online casinos within five months from each other.

PokerStars joined their group a year later, in 2016, adding one of the biggest video poker networks in the world to the already bustling alliance. With their pooled resources, Mohegan Sun Casino Online managed to carve out a small but growing gambling empire of their own in the Garden State.

## WHAT SOFTWARE MOHEGAN SUN NJ USES
Mohegan Sun Casino uses the software provided to them by NYX Gaming, a well-established company specializing in the development of online games for gambling platforms. NYX has a deserved reputation as one of the best developer companies in the field, and that is further established by the fact that more than 200 casinos worldwide use their software. Their games are reliable, highly customizable, and have good production value.

What’s even better is the fact that software from NYX is compatible with all the latest releases from such industry giants as NetEnt, IGT and Aristocrat, so casinos can easily expand their gaming catalog without worrying about the compatibility.

Players who want to check out Mohegan Sun Online can do so both through the desktop version and the mobile app.

### DESKTOP VERSION
Players will get a full experience by playing through a desktop version. It doesn’t require you to download any client, the only thing that is needed is a compatible browser. As such, it can be played on Windows, Linux, and Mac, as long as you can use a modern browser. Supported browsers are Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari.

The browser must support the latest Adobe Flash plugin, as all casino games are using Flash to play out. In addition to that, players will need to have a special geolocation plugin, as New Jersey gaming laws require players to physically be in the state of New Jersey in order to have access to the real money games.

The geolocation plugin will be downloaded automatically during the first attempt to play a real-money game on the site.

## MOHEGAN SUN APPLICATION
The mobile app for Mohegan Sun Casino is not an afterthought. Players will be able to enjoy more than 200 games adapted for mobile devices, encompassing the whole variety of desktop catalog: slots, roulette, blackjack, and video poker.
You will be able to download the app from iTunes for iOS devices, and from Google Play Stire for Android. However, take note that, since the app is updated regularly, it has steep hardware requirements to run smoothly, along with a modern OS version.

As is with the desktop version, you should be physically located in the state of New Jersey to enjoy your gambling. If you cross the border at the moment of playing, your session will be instantly terminated by the app itself. You should also have at least 512 KB/s internet connection to enjoy games without lags or freezes.

## MOHEGAN SUN NJ GAME CATALOG
As of this moment, Mohegan Sun Casino is one of the triumvirate of casinos that have more than 400 games in their catalog, along with Golden Nugget and Resorts Casino. Other gambling sites, even SugarHouse or Caesars Casino, are currently in the lower league, only trying to unlodge one of the titans from its pedestal. However, given that Mohegan Sun NJ Online constantly updates its catalog, adding more games, its status will probably not change anytime soon.

### SLOT GAMES TERMINALS
Slots take a special place in the catalog of Mohegan Sun NJ. At the moment of this review’s writing, there are 409 available titles. That puts it in third place after Resorts Casino (419 slots) and Golden Nugget (410 slots). So, if you are looking for something different, you will not get bored here for quite a while.

Mohegan has slots with a different number of paylines – from 5 to hundreds, different bonuses, and different numbers of reels. If you can name the slot type, this casino probably has them

Aristocrat, NetEnt, IGT, SG Gaming, and Williams Interactive all pitched in the development of this catalog’s segment. The design of their games is pretty great, sounds are satisfying, and quality is top-notch.

Some of the most popular titles among the players are:

+ Blood Suckers II
+ Vampires vs Werewolves
+ Legend of the Pharaoh
+ Irish Eyes 2
+ Pixies of the Forest 
+ ROULETTE GAMES

For roulette lovers, there are eight options for you to choose:

+ Roulette
+ Classic Roulette
+ American Roulette
+ Two variants of European Roulette

Take note, that European roulette is better in terms of return of investment, as it doesn’t have a double zero spot, increasing your chances of winning significantly. 

### OTHER GAMES
Besides blackjack tables, Mohegan Sun Casino offers a variety of other table games: two draw poker games and one baccarat table. In addition to that, there are also seven scratcher games, with Medusa and Witch Pickings being the most popular ones.
There are also Slingo games in the Slots category. They combine features from slots and classic bingo to create a unique blend. 

## MOHEGAN SUN BONUS CODE AND PROMOTIONS
It wouldn’t be a full and informative Mohegan Sun New Jersey review if we didn’t cover bonuses, promotions, and loyalty programs that it has. Currently, there are two welcoming bonuses for new players.

### $20 NO-DEPOSIT BONUS
When creating your account on Mohegan Sun Casino, use the MAXBONUS bonus code to get a $20 no-deposit bonus. 

The money will be added to your bankroll after your identity is confirmed by the casino’s staff. Usually, it takes less than 48 hours.

The bonus itself has an x5 wagering requirement, which means that you will need to wager $100 to be able to withdraw it.

### 100% MATCH ON FIRST DEPOSIT
After you’ve created your account, and started to make a deposit, you will get a 100% bonus match to your first deposit, for up to $1,000. That is a lot of cash for any New Jersey casino, however, it has an x20 wagering requirement to withdraw.

Take note that only slots contribute the whole amount of bet to the requirement, other games will bring you only 20%. That means, that you would have to bet $100,000 to fully realize your $1,000 bonus.
That leaves slots as the most valid way to get it back, so it would be better to choose slots with 

## MOHEGAN SUN ONLINE CASINO VIP PROGRAM
As with many self-respected online casinos, Mohegan has a loyalty +program that allows its players to accumulate bonus points, which will determine their loyalty level. That level, in turn, will set the maximum cashback from games.

Bonus points are called Elevate Points (EP). Different games contribute differently:

+ Slots: get 1 EP per $2;
+ Roulette: get 1 EP per $4;
+ Table games and poker: get 1 EP per $8;

Points will be accounted for monthly to determine your loyalty level. Currently, Mohegan Sun Casino has nine levels in its program. Here you can find all of them, along with EP requirement:

+ Storm – 0 required points – 4,000 EPs per $1 of bonus money (cashback rate on slot bets: 0.03%)
+ Thunder – 1,000 required points – 2,500 EPs per $1 of bonus money (cashback rate on slot bets: 0.04%)
+ Lightning – 5,000 required points – 1,000 EPs per $1 of bonus money (cashback rate on slot bets: 0.10%)
+ Spark – 20,000 required points – 606 EPs per $1 of bonus money (cashback rate on slot bets: 0.17%)
+ Flash – 50,000 required points – 500 EPs per $1 of bonus money (cashback rate on slot bets: 0.20%)
+ Flare – 150,000 required points – 400 EPs per $1 of bonus money (cashback rate on slot bets: 0.25%)
+ Wildfire – 400,000 required points – 200 EPs per $1 of bonus money (cashback rate on slot bets: 0.50%)
+ Heat – 1,000,000 required points – 167 EPs per $1 of bonus money (cashback rate on slot bets: 0.60%)
+ Blaze – 2,000,000 required points – 133 EPs per $1 of bonus money (cashback rate on slot bets: 0.75%)

Of course, the cashback rate for games other than slots will be lower, as it is an obvious incentive for players to play slots, which have lower return rates. Here is an example of rates for other games at “Spark” tier of the program:

+ Blackjack, video poker – 0.04% cashback
+ Roulette – 0.02% cashback
+ For a “Storm” tier it looks even worse:

Blackjack, video poker – 0.01% cashback
Roulette – 0.00% cashback
As such, it is obvious that this loyalty program is aimed at high-rolling players, and casual players won’t get much out of it, besides a bit of extra cash. That is if they clear their welcome bonus through slots during their first month.
