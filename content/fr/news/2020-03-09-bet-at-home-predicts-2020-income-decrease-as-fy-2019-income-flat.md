Bet-at-home gross wagering and gaming income was 143.3m ($163.9m) for the entire year 2019, precisely equivalent to the earlier years income of 143.4m. 

EBITDA for 2019 was 35.2m, a fall of 3&percnt; year-on-year, while income before charges were 33.1m, down 5&percnt;. 

Marketing costs during the year were 39.8m, an ascent of 4&percnt; from 2018, and united benefit was 18m, down 45&percnt;. 

Despite this, the German administrator accomplished the most noteworthy wagering and gaming volume in its history, at 3.2bn. 

As of 31 December 2019, Bet-at-home had 5.2 million enlisted clients, up 4&percnt; from the earlier year. 

In its expectations for 2020, Bet-at-home gauges net income of somewhere in the range of 120m and 132m, with EBITDA of somewhere in the range of 23m and 27m. 

The administrator ascribes this anticipated decay to the loss of fundamental pieces of the Swiss market and the huge decrease in the Polish market. 

Although the administrator concedes administrative changes in Germany could prompt a potential decrease in income, it closes this can at present not be evaluated and is along these lines not considered.
