Malta-based software provider, Nolimit City, has agreed terms with SBTech to integrate its portfolio of popular RNG video slot games to the award-winning supplier&rsquo;s iGaming platform.

The agreement follows several high-profile partner deals and Nolimit City&rsquo;s increasing presence at must-attend industry events such as Sigma in Malta and will see its full portfolio of premium video slot games made available to SBTech&rsquo;s platform partners.

The direct integration into SBTech&rsquo;s platform will be made available thanks to Nolimit&rsquo;s flexible, propriety RGS platform and SBTech&rsquo;s intuitive open casino vendor API. SBTech has a wealth of industry knowledge and experience, and powers some of fastest growing and best performing casino operators in Europe; including Virgin Bet, Moplay, Mansionbet, 10Bet and Sportnation.

Popular Nolimit City titles such as _Tombstone, Manhattan Goes Wild, Casino Win Spin, Oktoberfest_ and _Creepy Carnival_, to name just a few, will be introduced to the SBTech&rsquo;s partner network in early 2020.

**Malcolm Mizzi, Head of Sales at Nolimit City,** said: &ldquo;Our reach has grown leaps and bounds in 2019. Closing a deal with one of the most prominent sportsbook and casino platforms gives us far more legitimacy towards our goal to become the next big software supplier everyone knows and loves. SBTech have been a true pleasure to work with and we look forward to our partnership&rdquo;

**Andrew Cochrane, Chief Development Officer at SBTech**, added: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re delighted to add Nolimit City&rsquo;s engaging content to our award-winning iGaming platform. Our casino offering is among the best in the industry and we&rsquo;re always looking to add fresh and exciting new content so our global partners can offer players the ultimate gaming experience.&rdquo;
