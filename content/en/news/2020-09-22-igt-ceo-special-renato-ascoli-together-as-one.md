**What was IGTs direction going into 2020 dependent on the aftereffects of 2019?** 

IGT began 2020 with remarkable business energy. We had solid execution all through 2019 and a strong Q1 2020 before the overall conclusion of club and gaming corridors that initiated in March. In gaming, the quality of our center video portfolio, video poker deals, strength market openings and the development of our PlaySports impression in the US were among the numerous components that powered IGTs 2019 execution. Additionally, IGTs Lottery execution was driven by strong same-store deals development, winning new lottery contracts, critical agreement augmentations, and the worldwide extension of computerized lottery. 

**How before long did you perceive the reality of the pandemic?** 

IGT perceived the gravity of the COVID-19 pandemic at an opportune time. Given IGTs worldwide impression, we had representatives, clients and tasks, especially in Italy, encountering the strongly negative effect of the pandemic well before the reality of the circumstance was completely perceived and acknowledged by many. As an organization, IGT made snappy and definitive move and made six emergency the executives workstreams to address the accompanying: worker security, business congruity, client commitment, cost-investment funds activities, situation arranging and liquidity/money conservation. These proactive activities keep on securing the wellbeing and prosperity of our inside and outside partners and are principal to IGTs strong accounting reports and positive free income. 

**How has IGT had the option to adjust over** **the most recent couple of months, particularly in Q2, as far as break cost sparing activities?** 

Over the most recent a while, IGT took definitive cost investment funds and capital evasion activities, which are required to drive more than $500 million in fixed and optional cost investment funds in 2020. Moreover, we have distinguished over $200 million in basic cost reserve funds, essentially identified with certain vital activities including taking out duplicative capacities and smoothing out back workplaces; streamlining worldwide innovation to re-center around the estimation of accretive expertise; justifying RD venture dependent on hazard versus reward needs; and improving our gracefully chain with an attention on configuration to-cost proficiency.

**Can you detail the thinking behind IGTs long haul methodology changes in accordance with rearrange the organization into two worldwide specialty units?** 

There are a few key reasons why IGT chose to redesign into two particular specialty units, Global Gaming and Global Lottery. To begin with, this new structure positions IGT to give more noteworthy responsiveness to clients and players. Second, we can expand IGT&#8217;s viability and intensity in giving items and arrangements that address the chances of each market fragment. The new structure additionally orchestrates best practices across both B2B and B2C directs in every item classification. Furthermore, our new, more improved structure lessens unpredictability and increments authoritative effectiveness to help IGT&#8217;s characteristic worth. 

**Can you depict how lottery and gaming will coincide?** 

There is a characteristic relationship that will everlastingly exist among gaming and lottery inside IGT, yet additionally among administrators and players. There are innumerable business sectors around the globe where lottery and gaming administrators coincide and they flawlessly team up to hoist the player experience, drive strategy and development and amplify commitments to great motivations. 

We unequivocally accept that among IGTs most important resources are our associations with clients and controllers. This conviction was the key driver of our choice to keep up the current IGT single purposes of contact for these significant crowds, notwithstanding our inside partition into two specialty units. Given the achievement and life span of these exceptionally gainful and viable associations, we are certain that our openness and our discussions will keep on being as liquid as they were before IGTs redesign. 

Operationally, IGT will keep on profiting by operational collaborations got from our worldwide scale and authority in both gaming and lottery. For instance, well keep on assembling gaming and lottery gear in our Reno office, and our imaginative groups will keep on drawing upon IGTs industry-driving IP portfolio that is upheld by many years of advancement mastery across the two fragments. Indeed, even with the new specialty unit tasks, we are as yet One IGT. Our representatives around the globe are bound together by the shared objectives of driving development through unmatched gaming encounters and returning an incentive to our clients and investors. 

**Where would you say you are seeing energizing new open doors in each fragment, particularly gaming where you are driving?** 

We are in an extraordinary second where individuals are available to change and are promptly tolerating new innovations. This is apparent by the volumes of individuals who quickly went to an assortment of online administrations, for example, staple conveyance throughout the most recent a while. For an innovation organization, for example, IGT, this change in outlook is energizing as it makes development openings and a domain where innovation selection is prepared to happen at a quickened rate. Take for instance credit only gaming and our Resort Wallet item. Pre-COVID-19, Resort Wallet was still seen by certain administrators as an ideal to have or a tech-progressed choice for gambling clubs hoping to separate their contribution. Today, credit only gaming innovation is profoundly wanted by administrators for its capacity to decrease the requirement for money dealing with and to bring down supporter and staff reliance on in-person cooperations. 

I am similarly amped up for the enormous work of our PlaySports group and the market openings in the games wagering portion. In the US, IGT has immovably settled its initiative as a B2B sports wagering innovation supplier, and with forthcoming games wagering enactment in numerous states the nation over, IGT is well situated for proceeded with sports wagering development. Likewise, our PlayDigital business is developing at a striking rate and we anticipate that our clients and their players should bridle that energy to make new chances. 

> We strongly believe that among IGTs most valuable assets are our relationships with customers and regulators. This belief was the key driver of our decision to maintain the existing IGT single points of contact for these important audiences, despite our internal separation into two business units

**Has the pandemic been such an impetus to zero in additional on computerized?** 

The pandemic has without a doubt raised the worldwide pertinence of and interest for advanced gaming across gaming and lottery. In Q2, IGTs worldwide B2B internet gaming bets were up 75&percnt; worldwide and they dramatically increased in North America. Our Italy tasks saw a 33&percnt; increment in advanced betting notwithstanding the nonattendance of sports wagering. Moreover, we saw 72&percnt; development in iLottery in Q2. I envision the upward direction in advanced gaming execution will proceed, particularly as players become progressively more alright with computerized types of amusement and as neighborhood governments distinguish better approaches to extend and enhance income models. Essentially, with numerous US states effectively characterizing their games wagering guidelines and procedures, I accept the pandemic and the publics comfort with portable diversion will help quicken the rate at which states present advanced games betting. 

**Can you detail IGTs the board attachment during this remarkable opportunity to guarantee worker maintenance and true serenity?** 

Employees are the core of IGT. Securing the wellbeing and prosperity of our representatives has been and keeps on being our first concern. We settled on some extreme choices right off the bat in the year to guarantee the drawn out money related soundness of the organization and that included transitory pay decreases, the present moment furloughing of certain representatives and noteworthy remaining burden realignment. Understanding the conceivably negative commitment suggestions that those conditions could incite, we settled on a key choice to increment and organize worker correspondence during that time. While furloughed representatives were away from IGT, we were constant about contribution select in correspondences from each degree of the association, regardless of whether as leader messages, Bright Spots messages that illustrated late business accomplishments or Zoom-based, discretionary parties. 

Today, with representatives once again from vacation and around 75&percnt; of our worldwide workforce working distantly, we proceed to refine and grow our worker commitment programs. Our People Transformation and Diversity Inclusion groups are endeavoring to convey a scope of electronic commitment exercises, trainings and expert development openings. I am gigantically glad for the strength, energy, creativity and versatility of the whole IGT workforce around the globe. 

**How would you say you are organizing your capacity to remain deft through progressing industry and worldwide flightiness?** 

Operating with readiness and being able to rapidly address the issues of our clients is a first concern and among the key inspirations for our ongoing broad rearrangement. Furthermore, IGT exceptionally values progressing, unfiltered correspondence with interior and outer partners. We invite the intense discussions from our representatives, clients and sellers, as we accept those trades are fundamental for genuine arrangement, cooperation and critical thinking. Raising concerns, openings and examples of overcoming adversity progressively empowers the initiative group to address these subjects with earnestness, and to guarantee that we are going about as quickly as conceivable to address our clients novel needs. 

**Based on the serious effect of this current year and the essential reactions to it, how is 2021 getting down to business and what hopefulness would you be able to give?** 

We will keep on giving our organization execution refreshes through our quarterly profit reports and calls. IGTs future is splendid. With a solid asset report, a broadened item portfolio, a strong lottery business and the most energetic, experienced and talented group in Gaming and Lottery, I am certain well keep on executing on our arrangements and drive development for our clients.
