At ICE London 2020, _NJ Slots Online_ talked with **Mark Woollard** , Business Development Director at Pragmatic Solutions, about the companys way to deal with working with administrators and its advancement plans for 2020. 

**How fruitful has your ICE been up until this point?** 

Yesterday was generally excellent. Weve had many individuals coming up to the stand. A great deal of administrators are keen on the stage and a ton of designers are keen on putting their substance on the stage. The stand we have here is awesome. Its extremely open and we get many individuals strolling through here. No issues up until now. 

**How significant do you think occasions like this are for the business?** 

I think its extremely significant, particularly for developing markets where you perhaps dont have the contacts or organizations set up as of now. For a stage professional this, its simple for individuals to simply look on a site and not really get all the data. For potential customers, having the option to take a gander at our stand and come up to us and ask us what we do and how we can affect on their business is extremely significant. 

**How do you draw in and offer to potential customers in a room loaded with rivalry?** 

Our marking is clear and clean. We additionally have a relationship with Pragmatic Play through the IBID Group which claims the two organizations. It truly helps that we are both here together. At that point were additionally exceptionally clear in what we do. Were IPA based, exceptionally secluded and all the marking is clear and brief. Rather than being over-confused in what we are attempting to offer, even on a stand premise with the marking, were attempting to be extremely clear so when individuals come up to the stand they will recognize what we do straight away. 

**What are probably the most significant advancements youve found in Pragmatic Solutions over the previous year?** 

Weve been attempting to get our name out there in the market. As I referenced, we are claimed by a similar business as Pragmatic Play which has a tremendous impression in the market, so our activity has been to tell individuals that Pragmatic Solutions is an extremely discrete business run freely. We are attempting to tell our clients what we can do, how we can support them and the speed at which we can move. The previous year has been about mindfulness in the commercial center and the following year is tied in with attempting to sign those serious deals and get the administrators across to us. 

**Last year, you got UK accreditation for your foundation. How was this permitting procedure?** 

The stage is truly ready to go into new markets rapidly so it wasnt excessively troublesome. It is entirely versatile to economic situations whether that be in the UK or somewhere else, and we have an extraordinary consistence group. Marry really done a great deal of work for GLI-19 which is the highest quality level for stages across a wide range of business sectors, so on the grounds that we had just done that procedure the UK was only an extra box ticking exercise for us. 

**How do you plan on having an effect on such a serious market as the UK?** 

We offer something altogether different in light of the fact that we give administrators full command over their predetermination and what they do. When youre working with different stages you may need to take their club item, their bingo item, their games and their live seller. While we have those ideas from better places in the commercial center, we permit administrators to pick who they need to go with and afterward we incorporate. We dont put them into an interior guide where theyre rivaling their home items. 

Thats a genuine key contrast for a commercial center like the UK. In the event that you can control your contribution and make that extraordinary, for state the UK domain versus Spanish region, all on one framework, that just makes for a considerably more impressive activity for an administrator. 

**Outside of the UK, what are the other key markets for Pragmatic Solutions in 2020?** 

Weve been focussed on investigating the US advertise. There is a major open door for the large US organizations to possess their own foundation. We really offer answers for clients where we installed them, we give them how great the stage is and afterward we give them the choice to purchase the source code which implies that they at that point possess their own case of the stage. We would then be able to help with preparing and help with refreshes. For the US advertise that appears to have been something that individuals are exceptionally intrigued by. 

Obviously the UK and Europe is a significant space. One of our customers is 21.com and theyre clearly a serious European based business so we have a great deal of involvement in Maltese sort administrators. What we are attempting to do isn&#8217;t focus on one explicit market. We are available to all business sectors and can help encourage what administrators need to do. 

**What are the key difficulties confronting Pragmatic Solutions this year?** 

Platforms all in all are not commonly comprehended by many individuals. Indeed, even at the gathering here weve been asked do I put my games on your foundation? That would be a RGS stage. Were an altogether different contribution. Were a center PAM stage, a web based Gaming arrangement over everything like your back office, installments, and coordinating tasks. That mindfulness despite everything should be raised. 

People dont essentially comprehend what a PAM stage is or how it can profit your business. We have to tell administrators why having one provider for your PAM and afterward coordinating with different for different things is the most ideal route forward &#8212; the more we can get that out there the better. Its not as provocative a discussion as state space games or bingo games yet its likely the greatest discussion you will have on the grounds that once you have a decent center strong framework you can expand what&#8217;s more. 

**What is the supreme center this year from an improvement point of view?** 

We are an exceptionally proactive business in that we need to stay aware of guidelines and what every domain requires from a stage, yet we generally work with customer guides. The absolute best criticism we have from our present customers is that they have a feeling that they are building their own framework. When they put a solicitation in of what they need to see, we ensure we encourage it. Were not receptive. We dont see something available which could be that years best thing, coordinate it and afterward administrators miss out on assets. We respond to what administrators need and afterward we expand on that. 

Our 2020 guide will be directed by what our administrators need and what they see as the patterns. You dont need your foundation to mention to you what the patterns are; you are the administrator, you comprehend the players, so you disclose to us how you need to function and what you need to do. At that point we will do that for you rapidly.
