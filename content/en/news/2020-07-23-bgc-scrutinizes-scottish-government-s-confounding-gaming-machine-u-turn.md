The Betting and Gaming Council (BGC) has scrutinized a choice by the Scottish Government to backtrack on the lifting of wagering shop limitations. 

Earlier this month, the Scottish Government consented to lift various limitations which had been put on the countries wagering shops since they revived on 29 June after a time of COVID-19 constrained terminations. 

These limitations incorporated the expulsion of seats from wagering shops and bans on live dashing on TV and the utilization of gaming machines. 

Although consenting to lift the limitations on 22 July, the Scottish Government has requested wagering shops to by and by shut down their gaming machines in what the BGC has portrayed as a clear U-turn. 

According to the BGC, Scottish limitations have prompted a fall in turnover of up to 95&percnt; for some wagering shops. 

In a letter to BGC CEO Michael Dugher clarifying the choice, a Scottish Government official depicted a craving to have a steady methodology with respect to the utilization of gaming machines while continually protecting individuals. 

Brigid Simmonds, executive of the BGC, remarked: We are incredibly baffled by the Scottish Governments choice, which legitimately negates what they let us know already. 

I would encourage clergymen in Scotland to earnestly rethink this confounding choice and return to the position they had not exactly seven days prior.
