With regards to online casinos, there have been no significant grievances about the way DGE administers them.

State specialists for the DGE watch over the every day casino tasks of the Golden Nugget Casino, and if any criminal questions emerge they have the New Jersey State Police available to them. They likewise have a Technical Service Bureau which audits and assesses the entirety of the games and payout tables to ensure everything is working with accountability and transparency. Considering these realities, we feel incredibly great saying that the Golden Nugget is a sheltered spot to gamble on the internet because of its highly regulated nature.
