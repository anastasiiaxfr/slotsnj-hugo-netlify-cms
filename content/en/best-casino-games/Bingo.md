When you speak of bingo, the first thing that comes to mind is a gathering of older people playing some boring game. Of course, it could be just that, but we will talk about the casino variation of the game, and casinos know how to make their games entertaining. Nowadays online bingo games offer a lively atmosphere, progressive jackpots, bonuses, and tournaments, as well as interplayer interactions through online chatrooms.

## HOW DO YOU PLAY ONLINE BINGO?
You don’t need to put in hours upon hours of research should you wish to play bingo. All in all, it is a simple game with a rather simple set of rules. It is also not based on a skill unlike poker, so there is nothing barring your entrance in the gambling scene there. That’s what makes the game so popular. In fact, it’s likely that you’ve already played it at least once in your life before the game even become available online. The online version of the game plays pretty much the same as the offline version. You need to choose the type of game you want to play and to buy tickets for it. After that, you will need to wait and see if the number on your card is called out. After you’ve got yourself a winning combination, you will be announced as a winner automatically. The only real rule in the game is to treat your fellow players courteously. No need to taunt them or mock them. And, of course, there should be no profanity in the chat room. That doesn’t mean that you are left without your bragging rights, of course.

## BINGO GAMES: SO DIFFERENT AND STILL SO SIMILAR
The same as with playing the game, choosing the right type of bingo doesn’t really require any research. Despite the game having a few varieties, the ruleset remains pretty much the same across all of them. The most popular types of the game are 75-ball Bingo and its longer cousin 90-ball Bingo.

### 30-BALL BINGO
A short version of the game focusing on quick games. It is popular among people who don’t have much time to wait for all numbers being revealed, and it consists of only 30 balls with numbers. With such a small number of balls and smaller game cards, the match could be concluded and started anew much quicker.

### 75-BALL BINGO
The classic version of any Bingo is the most popular in the United States and among casino goers in general. You can find it pretty much anywhere, so it is the most available version as well. The game card consists of 25 fields, and there are 75 balls to match, with horizontal, vertical, and diagonal matches announcing a winner.

### 80-BALL BINGO
A little longer version of the classic 75-ball Bingo, it has the same rules, though it also gives win on filling in a whole game field or four corners.

### 90-BALL BINGO
The longest variant of the game, it has 90 balls and has three different rounds allowing to have multiple victors. Namely, there could be up to 3 winners in the game.

## HOW CAN I PLAN MY VICTORIES?
The game itself is fairly simple, and it has no definitive way to win, as most of the game is built on pure chance. However, there are some tips that could help you in winning your match or at least be more aware of the game itself. Let’s dive into them:

Take note of peak hours: Online bingo has its share of peak hours each day, and sometimes in a week. The more players are out there, the lesser is your chance at victory, so make sure that you’ve chosen the time correctly. In addition to that, some days (and days after them) offer their own challenges.

Take a look at the number of active players: a good rule of thumb – if there is a big amount of active players, then your winning chances severely decrease. Avoid that by playing outside of peak hours, and buy as many tickets as possible to improve your winning chances.

Type of the game: basically, the lower is the number of balls, the higher is the winning chance. The 30-ball Bingo has a higher winning chance, as well as the quicker speed of the game. That means that the winner will be known in a matter of minutes, and the new game started just as quickly.

## CAN I BUY ONLINE BINGO TICKETS?
The short answer is: yes, you can. The long answer is: of course you can, it is fairly easy. In fact, it is harder to choose the site where you want to play. And you can do that with our help, of course. After that it is a matter of registration, confirming your location, and filling out your details. Once it is done, you can simply the desired game and purchase the required tickets. Once you are satisfied with the number of tickets and the type of the game, you can check them out online. And once you have your tickets, you can freely spend them on the game that you want.
