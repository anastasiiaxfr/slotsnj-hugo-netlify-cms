_Richard Schuetz, previous Executive Director at the Bermuda Gaming Control Board, President & CEO at the Stratosphere Hotel and Casino, and board counselor to Shuffle Master Gaming, Casino Publishing and the Institute for the Study of Gambling and Commercial Gaming at the University of Nevada, clarifies the excellence of ICE London, features what he accepts will be the intriguing issues bantered at the 2020 occasion and layouts what’s required for the business to be lively and feasible in the future_

**As you know, the ‘Progression into the future’ subject embraced to advance ICE London 2020 depended on one of your statements – how does that feel?**

When I initially read this, it made me laugh.  I altogether appreciate ICE and I think the individuals are incredible, so I was happy and respected to have my name related with it.  It despite everything makes me grin and I laugh a bit.

**Do you remain by that opinion and do you despite everything respect a visit to ICE London as being, as you stated, ‘magical’?**

I do think the ICE show is magical.  There is such a decent variety of items and individuals, in addition to it is in one of my preferred urban areas in the world.  I have an entire gathering of companions that I simply observe at ICE, thus not exclusively is the show extraordinary, however the chance to get together with old companions is wonderful.  in particular, ICE is as yet a mirror into the future for anybody from the United States.

**What do you figure the intriguing issues and subjects will be at February’s occasion and in what course do you see the business heading?**

The innovation is constantly a significant piece of ICE and that is the general purpose of the expo floor.  The hotly debated issues will be the inquisitive move that a large number of the UK and EU administrators are in with their controllers and governments, the capability of future development of sports betting in the US (with a decent measure of enthusiasm with the clans, given the improvements in California) and potential new markets in Africa, Asia and South America.  I would likewise be intrigued to perceive how the issue of sex starts to turn into a bigger piece of the conversation.

**Taking your motivation from ICE London’s greeting to ‘Step into the future’, what do you figure the business will look like in 10 or 20 years’ time – what discussions do you figure Gaming experts will have at ICE London 2030 or 2040?**

I started working in the business in the mid 1970s as an approach to back my education.  The progressions from that point forward have been amazing.  Moreover, the pace of progress has quickened colossally, so it is past my psychological abilities to try and think about what it will resemble in 10 to 20 years.  I do know, in any case, that so as to be practical the business needs solid guidelines, it needs to work with a high level of honesty and morals and it needs to give protections to the vulnerable.  If it focuses on these zones, it will be dynamic and manageable in whatever structures it takes in future worlds.  Hopefully, I will even now be going to the show with the fervor and excitement that I feel today!
